As noted by @gerya2014, a scarcity of observational constraints through time and space makes the study of geodynamics on Earth extraordinarily challenging (Figure \@ref(fig:sparse)). Luckily, application of various computational approaches---simulation, interpolation, and applied statistics---enable geodynamic inquiry despite sparse datasets. This dissertation leverages computational methods to investigate a fundamental component of Plate Tectonic theory, *subduction*.

The rock record (red circles) encodes information about geodynamic processes throughout Earth's history, but only within approximately 100 $km$ of Earth's surface. Geophysical data (blue circles) provides images of Earth's deep interior, but only since the 20th century CE (or 10$^{-7}$ $Ga$).

Subduction occurs when two lithospheric plates converge and the denser plate *subducts* beneath the other at a *subduction zone*. Subduction zones are implicated in myriad geodynamic phenomena, including seismicity, metamorphism, volatile flux, volcanism, dynamic plate motions, and crustal deformation [@cizkova2013; @gonzalez2016; @hirauchi2010; @peacock1990; @peacock1991; @peacock1993; @peacock1996; @peacock1999a; @hacker2003; @vankeken2011; @grove2012; @gao2017]. These phenomena are largely defined by plate motions and mechanical behavior along the plate interface [@furukawa1993; @peacock1994; @peacock1996; @syracuse2010]. While a diverse set of thermo-kinematic boundary conditions intuitively implies an equally diverse range of mechanical behavior, previous work suggests mechanical behavior is rather uniform among presently active subduction zones [@furukawa1993; @wada2008; @wada2009]. An apparent juxtaposition between uniform mechanical behavior vs. diverse boundary conditions implies a very unintuitive model of subduction.

This dissertation is motivated by the following question. How can one quantify the diversity of mechanical behavior across a range of plausible subduction zone configurations? Each chapter focuses on quantifying an aspect of subduction zone mechanics using different computational approaches and datasets.

Chapter \@ref(chpt2) numerically simulates oceanic-continental subduction across a range of thermo-kinematic boundary conditions and plate coupling is observed after 10 $Ma$. Multivariate linear regression is then used to formulate an expression for estimating coupling depth. The expression requires estimates for upper-plate thickness, which can be inverted from surface heat flow. Average upper-plate surface heat flow for 13 presently active subduction zones yield a narrow distribution of coupling depths---supporting the idea of broadly uniform mechanical behavior among subduction zones.

Chapter \@ref(chpt3) takes a closer look surface heat flow by quantifying its spatial variability in 2D. Two interpolations methods, Kriging and Similarity, are compared to assess their relative effectiveness. While one approach yields more favorable error rates, both show diverse spatial patterns of surface heat flow in contradiction to broadly uniform coupling depth predicted in Chapter \@ref(chpt2). Dataset scaling and new improvements to interpolation methods promise better tools for evaluating geodynamic variability among subduction zones.

Finally, Chapter \@ref(chpt4) applies machine learning techniques to recognize detachment of subducting markers (representing recovered rock fragments) from the numerical simulations in Chapter \@ref(chpt2). A large (`r format(nrow(fts.summary[fts.summary$rec,]), big.mark = ',')`) \glsfirst{ptt} dataset of recovered marker is compared across numerical experiments and with a global compilation of \glsfirst{hp} metamorphic terranes (the rock record). Marker \gls{ptt} distributions are distinct from the rock record, likely pointing to inherent sampling bias introduced by aggregating undifferentiated \gls{hp} rocks into a single composite dataset. Both marker \gls{ptt} distributions and marker recovery rates correlate with thermo-kinematic boundary conditions, suggesting non-uniform mechanical behavior among subduction zones.

## Abstract {#chpt2Abstract}

Deep mechanical coupling between converging plates is implicated in dynamic plate motions, crustal deformation, seismic cycles, arc magmatism, detachment (recovery) of subducting material, and is considered a key feature of subduction zone geodynamics. This study uses two-dimensional numerical simulations of oceanic-continental convergent margins to investigate effects of thermo-kinematic boundary conditions on coupling---specifically focusing on thermal parameter ($\Phi$) and upper-plate thickness. Numerical simulations implement coupling by including the metamorphic (de)hydration reaction $antigorite \allowbreak \Leftrightarrow olivine + orthopyroxene + H_{2}O$ in the upper-plate mantle. Visualizing pressure-temperature-strain fields show thermal feedbacks regulating coupling depth dynamically with strong responses to upper-plate thickness and weak responses to $\Phi$. The results imply estimation of coupling depth is possible by inverting upper-plate thickness from surface heat flow. Moreover, surface heat flow sampled from the backarc region near 17 presently active subduction zones imply uniform upper-plate thickness, and thus uniform coupling depths among subduction zones.

## Introduction {#chpt2Intro}

Subduction geodynamics are largely defined by plate motions and mechanical behavior along the plate interface. For example, a transition from mechanically decoupled (plates moving differentially with respect to each other) to coupled plates (plates moving with the same local velocity) dramatically increases temperature by inducing mantle circulation in the upper-plate asthenospheric mantle [@peacock1994; @peacock1996]. Observations from numerical simulations and forearc surface heat flow imply coupling transitions occur globally within a narrow range of depths in modern subduction zones (70-80 $km$). Further, coupling appears essentially unresponsive to diverse thermo-kinematic boundary conditions, including oceanic-plate age, convergence velocity, and subduction geometry [@furukawa1993; @wada2008; @wada2009]. While uniform coupling depths among subduction zones are inferred from numerical simulations and surface heat flow, this phenomenon remains curious and unconfirmed to a large extent. To understand subduction zone geodynamics, it is essential to understand why modern subduction zones appear to achieve similar coupling depths despite differences in their physical characteristics.

Notwithstanding, many numerical geodynamic models use coupling depths of 70-80 $km$ as a boundary condition [@abers2017; @currie2004; @syracuse2010; @vankeken2011; @vankeken2018; @wada2012; @gao2014; @wilson2014], although not exclusively [e.g. 40-56 $km$, @england2010; @peacock1996]. Similar coupling depths among subduction zones is an attractive hypothesis for at least two reasons. First, it helps explain a relatively narrow range of depths to subducting oceanic-plates beneath volcanic arcs [@england2004; @syracuse2006] as mechanical coupling is expected to be closely associated with the onset of flux melting. Second, mechanical coupling is required to detach crustal fragments from the subducting plate [@agard2016], so uniform coupling depths may also help explain why maximum pressures recorded by subducted oceanic material worldwide is $\leq$ 2.3-2.5 $GPa$ [roughly 80 $km$, @agard2009; @agard2018].

The location and extent of mechanical coupling along the plate interface is implicated in myriad geodynamic phenomena, including seismicity, metamorphism, volatile flux, volcanism, plate motions, and crustal deformation [@cizkova2013; @gonzalez2016; @hirauchi2010; @peacock1990; @peacock1991; @peacock1993; @peacock1996; @peacock1999a; @hacker2003; @vankeken2011; @grove2012; @gao2017]. Consequently, the mechanics of coupling have been extensively studied and discussed. Coupling fundamentally depends on the strength (viscosity) of materials above, within, and below the plate interface. Water flux from compaction and dehydration of hydrous minerals with increasing \glsfirst{pt} forms layers of low viscosity sheet silicates near the plate interface. Transmission of shear stress between plates is inhibited by formation of talc and serpentine in the shallow upper-plate mantle [@peacock1999a]. Lack of traction along the interface, combined with cooling from the subducting plate surface, ensures a positive feedback between hydrous mineral formation and mechanical decoupling. Experimentally determined flow laws, petrologic observations, and geophysical observations all support the plausibility of this conceptual model of subduction interface behavior [e.g. @agard2016; @agard2018; @gao2014; @peacock1999a].

Experimental control over important thermo-kinematic boundary conditions make geodynamic numerical simulations essential for investigating such complex geodynamic environments. @wada2009 previously investigated the effects of $\Phi$ on coupling depths by numerically simulating 17 presently active subduction zones. Among other thermo-kinematic boundary conditions, their models specify convergence rate, subduction geometry, thermal structure of oceanic- and overriding-plates, and degree of coupling along the subduction interface. Notably, their experiments control for interface rheology and discriminate best-fit coupling depths based on observed forearc surface heat flow.

This study similarly specifies thermo-kinematic boundary conditions to numerically simulate the range of modern subduction zone systems, but regulates interface rheology dynamically by implementing metamorphic reactions that respond to evolving pressure-temperature-strain fields. Subduction geometry and coupling depth are not fully determined features, in other words, but spontaneous model outcomes within the range of specified boundary conditions discussed in Section \@ref(numMethods). As in previous studies [e.g. @ruh2015], rheological effects of the dehydration reaction $antigorite \allowbreak \Leftrightarrow olivine + orthopyroxene + H_{2}O$ are implemented to drive mechanical coupling. An abrupt viscosity increase accompanies antigorite (serpentine) destabilization, thereby inducing mechanical coupling, as defined by empirically-determined flow laws used in the experiments (Table \@ref(tab:materials)).

This chapter focuses on two fundamental questions. How does coupling depth respond to $\Phi$ *and* upper-plate thickness? And how stable is coupling depth through time? First, 64 convergent margins with variable upper-plate thickness and $\Phi$ are numerically simulated and mechanical plate coupling is observed. Thermal feedbacks within the system are visualized in terms of mantle temperature, viscosity, and velocity fields and coupling depth responses to a range of $\Phi$ and upper-plate thickness are quantified using multivariate linear regression. Three different regression models are then used to estimate coupling depths for 17 presently active subduction zones. Coupling depth estimates are narrowly distributed, regardless of regression model form. Finally, implications and questions regarding uniformity among subduction zones in terms of surface heat flow, upper-plate thickness, and coupling depth are discussed.

## Numerical Modelling Methods {#numMethods}

This study simulates converging oceanic-continental plates, where an ocean basin is being consumed by subduction at a continental margin (Figure \@ref(fig:init)). Initial conditions are modified from previous numerical experiments of active margins [@sizova2010; @gorczyk2007] using the code `I2VIS` [@gerya2003], although plate coupling was not the focus of their studies. An identical rheologic model with identical material properties (Table \@ref(tab:materials)), and a identical hydration/melt model (Table \@ref(tab:melts) & Appendix \@ref(deHydration)) to @sizova2010 are implemented. However, the version of `I2VIS` in this study differs from @sizova2010 in its initial setup, overall dimension, resolution, continental geotherm, dehydration model, and left boundary condition (origin of new oceanic lithosphere). Differences are outlined in this section and in Appendix \@ref(deHydration). Sixty-four `I2VIS` models constructed with varying convergence rates ($\vec{v}_{conv}$), oceanic-plate ages, and upper-plate thickness (Figure \@ref(fig:params)) were ran on the [Euler cluster](https://scicomp.ethz.ch/wiki/Euler) at ETH, Zürich for at least 100 timesteps.

### Initial Setup and Boundary Conditions {#numBCs}

Simulations are 2000 $km$ wide and 300 $km$ deep (Figure \@ref(fig:init)). In the model domain, three governing equations of heat transport, momentum, and continuity are discretized and solved with a conservative finite-difference marker-in-cell approach on a fully staggered grid as outlined in @gerya2003. Numerical resolution is non-uniform with higher resolution (1 $km$ x 1 $km$) in a 600 $km$ wide area surrounding the contact between the oceanic-plate and continental margin, then gradually changing to lower resolution towards the model boundaries (5 $km$ x 1 $km$, x- and z-directions, respectively). The left and right boundaries are free-slip and thermally insulating (Figure \@ref(fig:init)a, b). Implementation of "sticky" air and water allows for a free topographical surface with a simple linear sedimentation and erosion model. The lower boundary is open to allow for oceanic-plate descent with a spontaneous subduction angle [@burg2005].

A horizontal convergence force is applied to both plates in a rectangular region far from the continental margin (Figure \@ref(fig:init)c). An initial weak layer cutting the lithosphere permits subduction to initiate. The high-viscosity ($\eta = 10^{25}~Pa\cdot s$) rectangular convergence regions apply constant horizontal velocities without deforming the lithosphere. Subduction angle is governed by free-motion of the subducting plate. Similarly, subduction velocity varies with time in response to extension or shortening of the overriding plate. $\Phi$ is thus calculated as the product of the horizontal convergence velocity and the oceanic-plate age [c.f. @kirby1991; @mckenzie1969]. For convenience and consistency with the literature, this study presents $\Phi$ in units of $km$/100 (Figure \@ref(fig:params)a).

### Calculating Geotherms and Defining Lithospheric Thickness {#numGeotherms}

Oceanic crust is modeled as 1 $km$ of sediment cover overlying 2 $km$ of basalt and 5 $km$ of gabbro (Figure \@ref(fig:init)a). Oceanic lithosphere is continually made at a pseudo-mid-ocean ridge at the left boundary of the model (Figure \@ref(fig:init)b). An enhanced vertical cooling condition applied at 200 $km$ from left boundary adjusts for the proper oceanic-plate age, and therefore its lithospheric thickness as it enters the trench [@agrusta2013]. Oceanic-plate ages range from 32.6 to 110 $Ma$ and convergence velocities from 40 to 100 $km/Ma$ (Figure \@ref(fig:params)a). This range of parameters broadly reflects the middle-range of modern global subduction systems [@syracuse2006].

Initial continental geotherms are determined by solving the heat flow equation in one-dimension to 1300 $^{\circ}C$ (Figure \@ref(fig:params)b). This study assumes a fixed temperature of 0 $^{\circ}C$ at the surface, constant radiogenic heating of 1 $\mu W/m^{3}$ in the 35 $km$-thick continental crust, 0.022 $\mu W/m^{3}$ in the mantle, with thermal conductivities of 2.3 $W/mK$ and 3.0 $W/mK$ for the continental crust and mantle, respectively. Above, 1300 $^{\circ}C$, temperature is assumed to constantly increase by 0.5 $^{\circ}C/km$ (the mantle adiabat) to the base of the model domain.

Many studies define the base of the continental lithosphere at the 1300 $^{\circ}C$ isotherm, but it can be determined directly by visualizing viscosity and strain rate as the model progresses. The mechanical base of the lithosphere ($Z_{UP}$) in the models generally occurs near the 1100 $^{\circ}C$ isotherm---characterized by a rapid decrease in viscosity and increase in strain rate (Figures \@ref(fig:cdfStep1), \@ref(fig:cdfStep2), \@ref(fig:cdfStep3)). As such, this study considers oceanic and continental lithospheres as mechanical layers defined by viscosity, rather than defined merely by temperature. $Z_{UP}$ corresponding to backarc surface heat flow of 59, 63, 69, and 79 $mW/m^{2}$ are used in this study (Figure \@ref(fig:params)b).

### Metamorphic (De)hydration Reactions {#numHydration}

Using Lagrangian markers [@harlow1962; @harlow1964] to store and update material properties and pressure-temperature-strain fields allows for straight-forward numerical implementation of metamorphic reactions. This approach is key to regulating mechanical coupling dynamically in subduction zone simulations. For example, dehydration (eclogitization) of the oceanic-plate and (de)stabilization of serpentine in the upper-plate mantle may be effectively modelled by tracing marker \gls{ptt} paths while changing marker properties according to thermodynamically-stable mineral assemblages [e.g. @connolly2005]. For computational efficiency, however, water contents in this study are not computed by iteratively solving thermodynamic systems of equations. Instead, gradual eclogitization of oceanic crust is computed as a linear function of lithostatic pressure to a maximum depth of 150 $km$, or temperature of 1427 $^\circ C$, while including garnet-in and plagioclase-out reactions defined by @ito1971. Mantle (de)hydration is computed according reactions boundaries defined by @schmidt1998 with a maximum water content of 2 $wt.\%$ (explained below). This approach effectively simulates continuous influx of water to the upper-plate mantle with relatively low computational cost, beginning with compaction and release of connate water at shallow depths, followed by a sequence of reactions consuming major hydrous phases (chlorite, lawsonite, zoisite, chloritoid, talc, amphibole, and phengite) in different parts of the hydrated basaltic crust [@schmidt1998; @vankeken2011].

The extent of metamorphic reaction effects on mechanical coupling, and the exact (de)hydration reaction(s) likely responsible, are unknown. However, formation of brucite and serpentine from dry olivine near the plate interface are inferred to strongly regulate mechanical behavior [@hyndman2003; @peacock1999a; @agard2016]. Brucite notably breaks down at much lower temperatures than serpentine [@schmidt1998], so serpentine (de)stabilization arguably represents the key transition from a weak-to-strong upper-plate mantle deep in subduction zones. This study elects an implementation of serpentine (de)hydration for this reason. The reaction is assumed to be abrupt and discontinuous, which is a fine approximation for near-endmember compositions like (Mg-rich) peridotites. The \gls{pt} conditions of the reaction $antigorite \Leftrightarrow olivine + orthopyroxene + H_{2}O$ were numerically implemented by the following equation [after @schmidt1998]:

\begin{equation}
  T_{atg-out}(z)=
  \begin{cases}
    751.50+6.008\times10^{-3}z-3.469\times10^{-8}z^2,& \text{for } z < 63000m \\
    1013.2-6.039\times10^{-5}z-4.289\times10{-9}z^2,& \text{for } z>63000m
  \end{cases}
  (\#eq:antstab)
\end{equation}

where $z$ is the depth of a marker from the surface in meters and $T$ is temperature in Kelvins. This reaction boundary is consistent to within 25 $^{\circ}C$ of more recent experiments by @shen2015. Markers with internal temperature exceeding $T_{atg-out}(z)$ spontaneously form $olivine + orthopyroxene + H_{2}O$ and release their crystal-bound water. This implementation tacitly assumes thermodynamic equilibrium and is common to many versions of `I2VIS`.

Oceanic-plates of different ages are also tacitly assumed to dehydrate similarly with the above implementation. However, older (colder) oceanic-plates are expected to carry water to greater depths than younger (warmer) plates because of relatively delayed water-releasing reactions [@peacock1996]. Abrupt water release with serpentine dehydration (Equation \@ref(eq:antstab)) was tested to model deep water retention in cold oceanic-plates. Mechanical coupling behavior was indistinguishable from gradual water release models. This implies rates of water release are less important than the depth of serpentine stability. Explicitly modelling other major dehydration reactions are thus unlikely to significantly affect mechanical coupling behavior, yet likely to introduce numerical artifacts at great computational cost. A simplified gradual water release model for all oceanic-plates is therefore preferred.

Water released by rock forms discrete fluid particles that migrate with relative velocities defined by local deviatoric (non-lithostatic) pressure gradients [see Appendix \@ref(deHydration), @faccenda2009]. Fluid velocities are scaled by a 10 $cm/yr$ vertical percolation velocity to account for purely lithostatic pressure gradients in the mantle [@gorczyk2007]. Fluid particles migrate until encountering rock that can consume additional water by equilibrium hydration or melting reactions, (Equation \@ref(tab:melts)).

The shallow upper-plate mantle can theoretically store large amounts of water as serpentine may contain up to 13 $wt.\%$ water [@reynard2013] and is generally stable at shallow mantle conditions. Thermodynamic models predict 8 $wt.\%$ water in the shallow upper-plate mantle [@connolly2005]. However, seismic studies suggest most shallow upper-plate mantles are only partially serpentinized (< 20-40%), equating to water contents of approximately 3-6 $wt.\%$ [@abers2017; @carlson2003]. Many modes of mantle hydration are documented or inferred, including evidence for channelized fluid flow within ophiolites exhumed from subduction zones [@angiboust2012a; @angiboust2014; @zack2007; @plumper2017]. This study limits mantle wedge hydration to $\leq$ 2 $wt.\%~H_{2}O$ and assumes any excess $H_{2}O$ exits the system through channelized fluid flow during plastic or brittle deformation [@davies1999].

### Rheologic Model {#rheologicModel}

Contributions from dislocation and diffusion creep are accounted for by computing a composite rheology for ductile rocks, $\eta_{effective}$:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \frac{1}{\eta_{effective}} = \frac{1}{\eta_{diff}} + \frac{1}{\eta_{disl}}
  \end{aligned} 
  (\#eq:ductile)
\end{equation}

where $\eta_{diff}$ and $\eta_{disl}$ are effective viscosities for diffusion and dislocation creep.

For the crust and serpentinized mantle, $\eta_{diff}$ and $\eta_{disl}$ are computed as:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \eta_{diff} &= \frac{1}{2} \ A \ \sigma_{crit}^{1-n} \ \exp\left[\frac{E+PV}{RT}\right] \\
    \eta_{disl} &= \frac{1}{2} \ A^{1/n} \ \dot{\varepsilon}_{II}^{(1-n)/n} \ \exp\left[\frac{E+PV}{nRT}\right]
  (\#eq:crust)
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where $R$ is the gas constant, $P$ is pressure, $T$ is temperature in $K$, ${\dot{\varepsilon}}_{II} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}{{\dot{\varepsilon}}_{ij}}^{2}}$ is the square root of the second invariant of the strain rate tensor, $\sigma_{crit}$ is an assumed diffusion-dislocation transition stress, and $A$, $E$, $V$ and $n$ are the material constant, activation energy, activation volume, and stress exponent, respectively [Table \@ref(tab:materials), @hilairet2007; @ranalli1995].

For the mantle, $\eta_{diff}$ and $\eta_{disl}$ are computed as [@karato1993]:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \eta_{diff} &= \frac{1}{2} \ A^{-1} \ G \ \left[\frac{h}{b}\right]^{m/n} \ \exp\left[\frac{E+PV}{RT}\right] \\
    \eta_{disl} &= \frac{1}{2} \ A^{-1/n} \ G \ \dot{\varepsilon}_{II}^{(1-n)/n} \ \exp\left[\frac{E+PV}{nRT}\right]
  \end{aligned}
  (\#eq:mantle)
\end{equation}

where $b$=$5\times10^{-10}$ $m$ is Burgers vector, $G$=$8\times10^{10}$ $Pa$ is shear modulus, $h$=$1\times10^{-3}$ $m$ is the assumed grain size, $m=2.5$ is the grain size exponent, and the other flow law parameters are given in Table \@ref(tab:materials). Viscosity is limited in all numerical experiments from $\eta_{min} = 10^{17}\ Pa \cdot s$ to $\eta_{max} = 10^{25}\ Pa \cdot s$.

An effective visco-plastic rheology is achieved by limiting $\eta_{effective}$ with a brittle (plastic) yield criterion:

\begin{equation}
  \eta_{effective} \leq \frac{C + \phi \ P}{2 \ \dot{\varepsilon}_{II}}
  (\#eq:plastic)
\end{equation}

where $\phi$ is the internal friction coefficient, $C$ cohesive strength at $P$ = 0, and ${\dot{\varepsilon}}_{ij}$ is the strain rate tensor (Table \@ref(tab:materials)).

### Visualization and Determination of Coupling Depth

The rheologic model and thermo-kinematic boundary conditions described in the previous sections always results in plate motions towards the left boundary (slab-rollback). Relatively high dip angles and extreme subduction velocities in some high-$\Phi$ experiments cause chaotic behavior by 10 $Ma$ as the upper-plate is stretched thin and mechanical interference occurs between trench sediments and the high-viscosity convergence region 200 $km$ from the left boundary. Numerical solutions are stable for most experiments, however, reaching quasi-steady state by 5 $Ma$. An additional 5 $Ma$ is allowed to ensure stable geodynamics before observing coupling depth. Surface heat flow, rock type, temperature, viscosity, strain rate, shear heating, and velocity fields are visualized at approximately 10 $Ma$ (e.g. Figure \@ref(fig:comp)) for all 64 experiments to assess geodynamics and solution stability (Figure \@ref(fig:antDepth)).

```{r comp, fig.cap='Visualizing model cdf with a 78 $km$ upper-plate lithosphere at approximately 10 $Ma$. (a) Rock type shows a thin serpentine layer (pink) lubricating the plate interface. Note that low melt volumes are inconspicuous and quickly extracted. (b) Viscosity shows high contrast between the oceanic-plate and serpentinized upper-plate mantle at shallow levels. Viscosity contrast disappears where serpentine becomes unstable. (c) Streamlines show focused mantle flow towards the interface, coinciding with the lower limit of serpentine stability. Note the converging isotherms that imply a feedback between heat transfer, serpentine destabilization, and mechanical coupling. (d) Strain rate shows localized deformation in the serpentine layer along the plate interface. Note that deformation in the upper-plate mantle is restricted to viscous flow beneath the lithosphere and along narrow, subvertical melt conduits.

```

After approximately 10 $Ma$ of subduction coupling depth is determined directly from viscosity by finding the approximate area where strength contrasts between serpentinized- and non-serpentinized upper-plate mantle diminishes to $<$ 10$^2$ $Pa \cdot s$. The node nearest to this region is assigned as the coupling depth. This study assumes mechanical coupling occurs instantaneously and at a single node. Mechanical coupling in reality must be dispersed across a finite length along the plate interface, however. At the numerical resolution the experiments, coupling-like viscosity contrasts are similar within a small area (approximately 5 $\times$ 5 $km$ or 5 $\times$ 5 nodes), giving a qualitative uncertainty coupling depth on the order of 2.5 $km$.

## Results {#chpt2Results}

### Coupling Depth Estimators {#cdEstimators}

Coupling depth ($Z_{cpl}$) correlates strongly with upper-plate thickness ($Z_{UP}$) and weakly with $\Phi$ across all 64 numerical models (Table \@ref(tab:zcResults), Figures \@ref(fig:results) & \@ref(fig:biv)). The responsiveness of coupling depth to $Z_{UP}$ but not to $\Phi$ is a key result of this study. The following equation minimizes standard least squares while optimizing the number of parameters, *p value*, and $R^2$ for all possible permutations of the variables $Z_{UP}$ and $\Phi$ in linear and quadratic forms:

\begin{equation}
  Z_{cpl} = 4.95\times 10^{-3}\ Z_{UP}^{2}\ -\ 9.27\times 10^{-2}\ \Phi\ +\ 63.6
  (\#eq:zCpl)
\end{equation}

where $Z_{cpl}$ is coupling depth in $km$ and $\Phi$ is the thermal parameter in $km/100$. Regression summaries show both linear and quadratic models of $Z_{cpl}$ vs. $Z_{UP}$ and $\Phi$ fit experimental results well (Tables \@ref(tab:anova) & \@ref(tab:regSummary)). Equation \@ref(eq:zCpl) represents a statistical model formulated with observations from physics-based simulations of subduction. Equation \@ref(eq:zCpl) is useful for estimating coupling depths in active subduction zones where $\Phi$ is known and $Z_{UP}$ can be inverted from surface heat flow.

Sensitivity of coupling depth to upper-plate thickness and $\Phi$ is apparent when visualizing Equation \@ref(eq:zCpl) and other regression models across $Z_{UP}$ and $\Phi$ space \@ref(fig:multiv). Applying Equation \@ref(eq:zCpl) to 17 active subduction zone segments (Table \@ref(tab:segs)) gives a wide range of estimated coupling depths, similar to the numerical simulations in this study. The distribution of estimated coupling depths, however, is relatively narrow and quasi-normal, with a mean of $\sim$ 82 $km$ and standard deviation of 7 $km$ (Figure \@ref(fig:multiv)d).

```{r multiv, fig.cap='Multivariate regressions and estimated coupling depth ($Z_{cpl}$) for 17 active subduction zone segments.

### Surface Heat Flow

Upper-plate surface heat flow remains relatively stable and reflects initial upper-plate geotherms in the backarc region for experiments with low to moderate $\Phi$ (Figure \@ref(fig:hf)). However, high-amplitude and high-frequency positive surface heat flow deviations in the upper-plate are common in all experiments, especially for high-$\Phi$ experiments. These deviations correspond to extensional deformation and heat transport via lithospheric thinning and melt migration. These features are apparent as subvertical low viscosity, high strain rate columns originating from the plate interface (Figure \@ref(fig:comp)b, d) and point to potential sources of error when inverting surface heat flow in active subduction zones. Notably, the backarc is relatively unaffected by fluid and melt migration compared to the forearc. Estimating upper-plate thickness by inverting surface heat flow in the backarc is therefore preferable to forearc surface heat flow.

```{r hf78, fig.cap='Surface heat flow ($\\vec{q}$) vs. normalized distance for model cdf with upper-plate thickness ($Z_{UP}$) ranging from 46 to 94 $km$. The distribution of $\\vec{q}$ in the forearc (normalized distance between 0.0 and 1.0) is narrow and shows little variance until near the arc (normalized distance between 0.75 and 1.0). The broad distribution of $\\vec{q}$ behind the arc (normalized distance $>$ 1.0) reflects the broad distribution of initial continental geotherms ($Z_{UP}$). Any simple relationship between $\\vec{q}$ and $Z_{UP}$ may be obscured by heating from extension or vertical migration of fluids, especially within the arc-region (high-amplitude fluctuations).', fig.scap='Surface heat flow calculated from numerical experiments'}

knitr::include_graphics('assets/figs/chpt2/fig5.png')

```

Surface heat flow across all numerical experiments is similar in the forearc region (normalized distance $\leq$ 0.75, Figure \@ref(fig:hf78)). In contrast, surface heat flow extending behind the arc region (normalized distance $>$ 0.75, Figure \@ref(fig:hf78)) increases systematically, then levels off at values reflecting initial continental geotherms (i.e. reflecting initial upper-plate thickness). In reality, surface heat flow depend on fault slip rates and rates of volcanic outputs. However, heat flow in the behind the arc may remain in steady-state if rates of volcanism and crustal thinning by extension are low [@currie2004; @currie2006].

## Discussion {#chpt2Discussion}

### Dynamic Feedbacks Regulating Plate Coupling

A clear association between plate coupling and the reaction $antigorite \allowbreak \Leftrightarrow olivine + orthopyroxene + H_{2}O$ is observed in all experiments. A relatively narrow serpentine channel quickly forms above the dehydrating oceanic-plate, localizing strain, lubricating the plate interface, and inhibiting transfer of shear stress between plates [e.g. @agard2016; @ruh2015]. This mechanical behavior is a direct consequence of a sharp rheologic change dependent on the location of serpentine dehydration reaction described in Section \@ref(numHydration) and its effect on the rheologic model described in Section \@ref(rheologicModel). Interactions among viscosity changes, serpentine dehydration, and heat transfer are regulated by competing dynamic feedbacks acting in the upper-plate. In summary, cooling and hydration of the shallow upper-plate mantle (serpentine stabilization) and heating from circulating asthenospheric mantle beneath the upper-plate lithosphere (driven by mechanical coupling) compete to stabilize coupling depth (Figure \@ref(fig:flow)).

The entire process can be conceptualized with Figure \@ref(fig:flow) as follows. The upper-plate mantle cools via diffusive heat loss to the oceanic-plate along the entire length of the plate interface (Figure \@ref(fig:flow)a). At shallow depths, water released from the oceanic-plate stabilizes serpentine in the overriding upper-plate mantle, effectively decoupling the two plates (Figure \@ref(fig:flow)b, point a). A positive feedback stabilizes serpentine to greater depths as decoupled plates stagnate the upper-plate mantle, promoting further cooling and formation of serpentine. Numerical experiments imply only a thin layer of serpentine is sufficient to trigger this feedback.

Deeper along the plate interface, beyond the stability of serpentine, diffusive heat loss from the upper-plate mantle to the slab forms a thickening layer of high-viscosity mantle atop the oceanic-plate (Figure \@ref(fig:flow)b, point b). Downward motion of the oceanic-plate, plus accreted high-viscosity mantle (Figure \@ref(fig:flow)b, point b) relative to the deepest extent of the stiff upper-plate mantle (Figure \@ref(fig:flow)b, point c) creates a pressure gradient that attracts flow of the weakest materials---serpentine from the up-dip direction (Figure \@ref(fig:flow)b, point d)---and hot mantle from below (Figure \@ref(fig:flow)b, point e). Flow of hot mantle into the necking region between points b and c in Figure \@ref(fig:flow) is analogous to passive asthenospheric upwelling toward a mid-ocean ridge where two strong cooling lithospheric plates diverge. Highly efficient heat advection from the warm upper-plate asthenospheric mantle (Figure \@ref(fig:flow)a) prevents formation of sperentine---thus regulating and stabilizing the coupling depth.

Coupling mechanics apparent from numerical experiments can be described in terms of competing positive and negative feedbacks. The positive feedback involves addition of water into a diffusively cooling, shallow mantle to produce serpentine. The negative feedback involves serpentine destabilization by advection of heat from the deeper upper-plate asthenospheric mantle. Such thermal-petrologic-mechanical feedbacks drive coupling depth towards steady-state. The numerical experiments in this study imply a finely-tuned balance of serpentine stability can maintain coupling depths in subduction zones for potentially 10's of Ma.

### Coupling Responses to $Z_{UP}$ and $\Phi$ {#cplResponses}

How does upper-plate thickness influence coupling depth? Numerical experiments point to the upper-plate lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary as an important feature constraining coupling mechanics as it defines the permissible flow field in the upper-plate (Figure \@ref(fig:streams)a-d). Thin upper-plate lithospheres (Figure \@ref(fig:streams)a, b) permit shallow mantle flow and advection of heat farther up the plate interface. Thin upper-plate lithospheres thereby raise coupling depths by raising serpentine stability up the plate interface. Thick upper-plate lithospheres (Figure \@ref(fig:streams)c, d) restrict mantle wedge flow to deeper levels, deepening serpentine stability and mechanical coupling.

The thermal state of the slab, as represented by $\Phi$, has almost no effect on coupling depth by comparison. Relative insensitivity of coupling depth to $\Phi$ is consistent with previous studies of active subduction zones [@furukawa1993; @wada2009]. The irresponsiveness of coupling depth to changes in $\Phi$ is perhaps  due to competing cooling and heating effects driven by the subducting oceanic-plate. For example, high-$\Phi$ oceanic-plates (older plates with higher velocities) cool the upper-plate mantle more effectively, but also effectively heat the interface by driving stronger mantle circulation. In contrast, low-$\Phi$ oceanic-plates (younger plates with lower velocities) are less effective in cooling the upper-plate mantle, but also ineffectively heat the interface by ineffectively driving mantle circulation. That is, the shallow vs. deep dynamic effects of $\Phi$ tend to cancel each other, explaining the lack of correlation between coupling depth and $\Phi$.

### Estimating Coupling Depths in Subduction Zones

Theoretically, coupling depth can be estimated directly by fitting forearc surface heat flow data using forward modelling approaches [e.g. @wada2009]. However, forward approaches typically adjust coupling depth independently from upper-plate thickness, which is inconsistent with an inherent link between coupling depth and upper-plate thickness discussed in Section \@ref(chpt2Discussion) (e.g. Figures \@ref(fig:hf78) & \@ref(fig:streams)). Moreover, many additional heat sources [e.g. shear heating and crustal plutonism, @gao2014; @reesjones2018] may contribute to forearc surface heat flow---increasing uncertainty when inverting upper-plate thickness from surface heat flow.

Assuming low degrees of backarc extension, estimating coupling depth in active subduction zones using Equation \@ref(eq:zCpl) with $Z_{UP}$ inverted from backarc surface heat flow is preferable to avoid additional uncertainties stemming from seismic and volcanic activity in the forearc. However, while $\Phi$ is inventoried for most active subduction zones [@syracuse2006], a corresponding dataset of $Z_{UP}$ does not exist. Several geophysical and petrologic methods might be considered for independent estimates of $Z_{UP}$ (e.g. seismic velocities, flexure, heat flow, mantle xenoliths). Backarc surface heat flow is still a good choice, however, because of its direct correspondence with $Z_{UP}$. For example, $Z_{UP}$ may be estimated using simple one-dimensional heat transport models assuming values for radiogenic heat production in the crust [@rudnick1998]. Special attention must be paid to crustal processes, including extension and magmatism, because additional heating will underestimate $Z_{UP}$ and, consequently, underestimate coupling depth.

All experiments are plotted on the same scale and location within the model domain. The flow of warm mantle is restricted to below the 1100$^{\\circ}C$ isotherm, which corresponds to the base of the upper-plate lithosphere ($Z_{UP}$). A minimum coupling depth ($Z_{cpl}$) appears to exist as models with extremely thin lithospheres (a) exhibit coupling at $\\sim$ 70-80 $km$ depth. $Z_{cpl}$ generally increases with increasing $Z_{UP}$ as mantle flow and advective heat transport are restricted to greater depths.', fig.scap='Visualizing mantle flow and coupling by upper-plate thickness'}

### Globally Similar Coupling Depths?

A $Z_{cpl}$ distribution of 82 $\pm$ 14 $km$ (2$\sigma$) estimated for active subduction zones in this study (Figure \@ref(fig:multiv)d) roughly match the preferred $Z_{cpl}$ inferred from forearc surface heat flow for Cascadia and NE Japan [75-80 $km$, @syracuse2010; @wada2009] $km$. The range of $Z_{cpl}$ estimated for active subduction zones in this study (Figure \@ref(fig:multiv)d) is relatively broad, however. For example, omitting Mexico and Nankai because their $\Phi$ values fall outside the range of $\Phi$ used for numerical experiments, estimated coupling depths range from almost 100 $km$ (Kyushu) to approximately 65 $km$ (Sumatra and NE Japan, Table \@ref(tab:segs)).

Coupling depth in active subduction zones are commonly assumed to be narrowly distributed around 70-80 $km$ [@wada2009; @syracuse2010]. The strong correlation between $Z_{UP}$ and $Z_{cpl}$ found from numerical experiments imply uniform coupling depths are possible if upper-plate thickness are globally uniform. The surface heat flow dataset compiled by @wada2009 (Table \@ref(tab:segs)) shows average backarc surface heat flow are indeed similar among active subduction zones---implying a narrow distribution of coupling depths (Figure \@ref(fig:multiv)d). Much of their dataset is based on @currie2006, who estimate upper-plate thickness for 10 circum-Pacific subduction zones of 50-60 $km$ (defined by the 1200 $^{\circ}C$ isotherm). Uniformly thin upper-plate thickness are corroborated by uniformly high heat flow ($>$ 70 $mW/m^{2}$), thermobarometric constraints on mantle xenoliths, and P-wave velocities [@currie2006]. An attempt is made to further corroborate the uniformity of upper-plate thickness in Chapter \@ref(chpt3) by interpolating surface heat flow near active subduction zones.

Although it still curious why upper-plates among subduction zones may have similar thicknesses, one can assume it is likely related to some processes of lithospheric erosion proposed for subarc lithosphere. These include: lithospheric delamination induced by lower crust eclogitization [@sobolev2005], small-scale convection caused by hydration-induced mantle wedge weakening [@arcay2006], thermal erosion [@england2010], mechanical weakening by percolating melts [@gerya2011], and subarc foundering of magmatic cumulates [@jull2001]. Most of these mechanisms are thus strongly related to mantle wedge hydration, melting, and melt transport toward volcanic arcs.

The metamorphic rock record may also imply consistency among coupling depths in subduction zones. For example, the demise of a serpentine channel and onset of coupling may provide a natural barrier such that rocks are more likely to be exhumed from within the channel than from below it. The relative abundance of blueschists and eclogites should then be greater for pressures below estimated coupling depths (approximately 2.4 $GPa$ or 70-80 $km$) than above them. This hypothesis will be explicitly explored in Chapter \@ref(chpt4). 

## Conclusions

Three important results are highlighted in this study:

1. Coupling depth is stabilized near the base of the upper-plate lithosphere by competing dynamic feedbacks regulating heat transport, serpentine dehydration, and mechanical coupling in the upper-plate mantle.

2. A simple expression fitted to coupling depths observed in numerical experiments allows the coupling depths to be estimated for active subduction zones by inverting upper-plate thickness from surface heat flow.

3. Uniform surface heat flow in circum-Pacific subduction zones [@currie2006; @wada2009] may indicate uniform coupling depths at approximately 80 $km$.

Questions remain, however, including: how do warm (thin) upper-plates persist over 100's of kilometers behind arcs and throughout the lifespan of subduction zones? How abruptly are dehydration reaction occurring along the subduction interface? How can expressions like Equation \@ref(eq:zCpl) be improved using natural datasets? Each of these questions may be considered for future research.

## Abstract {#chpt3Abstract}

Heat fluxing through the Earth's surface provides indirect observations of pressure-temperature-strain fields deep in subduction zones. Global heat flow databases are therefore essential for generating and testing hypotheses about subduction zone geodynamics. However, evaluating spatial variability of surface heat flow across large tectonic features requires careful projection and interpolation of sparse observations. This study investigates the accuracy and resolution of simple ordinary Kriging methods applied to surface heat flow near subduction zone segments. Kriging interpolations, based on the First Law of Geography (spatial continuity), are directly compared to an approach based on the Third Law of Geography (Similarity). Both methods are generally comparable and show diverse spatial patterns of (dis)continuous surface heat flow near subduction zones. Diverse spatial patterns of surface heat flow may imply spatially heterogeneous lithospheric thickness (contrary to expectations from Chapter \@ref(chpt2)), spatially heterogeneous dynamics, spatially heterogeneous near-surface perturbations, and/or undersampling relative to the scale and magnitude of spatial variability. The results highlight present challenges in evaluating spatial variability of subduction zone geodynamics from surface heat flow datasets and stress the importance of characterizing surface heat flow patterns to the fullest extent possible. Dataset scaling and developing new composite interpolation approaches will improve interpolation resolution and accuracy, promising better tools for distinguishing geodynamic variability among presently active subduction zones.

## Introduction {#chpt3Intro}

Heat escaping the solid Earth's surface indicates a dynamically cooling planet. Surface heat flow databases [@pollack1993; @hasterok2008; @lucazeau2019; @jennings2021] enable geodynamic investigations by relating the amount of heat escaping Earth's surface to heat-transferring and heat-generating subsurface processes like hydrothermal circulation, radioactive decay, fault motion, subduction dynamics, and mantle convection [@fourier1827; @kelvin1863; @parsons1977; @pollack1977; @stein1992; @hasterok2013; @stein1994; @rudnick1998; @furlong2013; @gao2014; @furukawa1993; @wada2009; @kerswell2020; @currie2004; @currie2006]. Surface heat flow observations have motivated research in many scientific and industrial fields as evident by more than 1,393 publications compiled in the largest and most recent surface heat flow database [`ThermoGlobe`, @jennings2021; @lucazeau2019].

While `ThermoGlobe` currently contains `r format(nrow(hf), big.mark = ',')` observations, the irregularly-spaced data only cover a small fraction of the Earth's surface [510,065,800 $km^2$, @archinal2018] with an average spatial density of only `r format(nrow(hf)/510065800*1e6, digits = 3)` $obs/Million\,km^2$. Estimating global or regional surface heat flow rates thus requires careful interpolation of sparse observations across relatively large distances, even in the most densely sampled regions. One approach to this problem is integrating geographic, geologic, geochronologic, and geophysical information into interpolation methods. In this approach, estimates for unknown target locations are selected from surface heat flow distributions constructed from global observation sites that have similar characteristics [e.g. sites have similar bathymetry, elevation, proximity to active or ancient orogens, seafloor age, upper mantle shear wave velocities, etc., @chapman1975; @lee1965; @sclater1970; @davies2013; @shapiro2004; @goutorbe2011; @lucazeau2019]. These methods are called *Similarity* methods (Figure \@ref(fig:similarityBuffer)) and follow assumptions embedded in the Third Law of Geography: *the more similar the geographic configuration of two points, the more similar their values* [@zhu2018]. Global scale problems are particularly suited for Similarity approaches as they do not rely on spatial density of observations. On the other hand, assumed interactions among many independent geologic proxies used to construct proxy surface heat flow distributions, each with its own assumptions and uncertainties, makes Similarity a complex combinatorial problem vulnerable to decisions about the number of proxies, proxy dataset quality, and simplified geologic models used to compute observable classes [see @goutorbe2011 for method details].

```

Similarity methods generally ignore any notion of spatial dependence, or continuity, of surface heat flow. Measures of proximity to orogens and active volcanic areas may be considered in Similarity methods [@goutorbe2011; @lucazeau2019], but these measures roughly reference spatial dependence to tectonic features and not to other nearby surface heat flow observations. Generally speaking, spatial (dis)continuity of surface heat flow reflects the (dis)continuity of subsurface geodynamics (assuming insignificant near-surface perturbations). For example, broad low surface heat flow regions on continents outline cratons and uniform surface heat flow near subduction zones are interpreted to reflect uniform lithospheric thickness [@currie2004; @currie2006; @hyndman2005] and mechanical coupling depths [@furukawa1993; @wada2009; @kerswell2020]. This phenomenon is encapsulated in the First Law of Geography: *everything is related, but nearer things are more related* [@krige1951; @matheron1963]. It is crucial for regional geodynamic investigations to characterize the spatial continuity of surface heat flow observations whenever possible.

In contrast to Similarity methods, ordinary Kriging [@krige1951] approaches interpolation by only considering the locations of nearby observations. Kriging conserves spatial dependence and ideally presents the *on-the-ground* reality given enough observations. However, accurate Kriging interpolations are challenging in geodynamically diverse settings because the method assumes second order weak stationarity (the relationship among surface heat flow observations is constant and only depends on the distance between points), which is likely violated in regions encompassing many interacting tectonic features. However, stationarity need only apply over the local Kriging domain, so this problem is overcome by careful choice of Kriging parameters. Although not applied in this study, modifications to Kriging may be considered, including relaxing assumptions of stationarity or applying techniques that respect the Second Law of Geography [*spatial phenomena are inherently heterogeneous*, @goodchild2004], such as directional Kriging or Markov-Bayes techniques [@bardossy1997].

This Chapter focuses on comparing the accuracy, resolution, and diversity of surface heat flow interpolations produced by Similarity and Kriging methods for 13 presently active subduction zones. The following questions are considered. At what resolution can spatial surface heat flow patterns be confidently resolved with the current global database? Are Kriging and Similarity methods comparable when applied to surface heat flow near subduction zones? What do the differences (if any) imply about geodynamic variability among active subduction zones, especially with respect to uniform upper-plate thickness discussed in Chapter \@ref(chpt2)?

First, ordinary Kriging is applied to the `ThermoGlobe` database [@lucazeau2019; @jennings2021] cropped within 1000 $km$ buffers around 13 presently active subduction zones defined by @syracuse2006. Kriging estimates and uncertainties are then directly compared (point-by-point) to Similarity interpolations from @lucazeau2019. The results show Kriging and Similarity methods are generally comparable for most subduction segments but Similarity estimates have considerably less error. This study highlights present challenges in inferring subduction zone geodynamics quantitatively from surface heat flow datasets and encourages characterization surface heat flow patterns to the fullest extent possible. Scaling datasets and developing composite interpolation approaches promise better tools for distinguishing geodynamic variability near active subduction zones.

## Methods

### The `ThermoGlobe` Database

The `ThermoGlobe` database is available from the supplementary material of @lucazeau2019 and is accessible online at \url{http://heatflow.org} [@jennings2021]. It currently contains `r format(nrow(hf), big.mark=',')` data points, their locations in latitude/longitude, and important metadata---including a data quality rank (`Code 6`) from A (high-quality) to D (low-quality). The reader is referred to @lucazeau2019 and \url{http://heatflow.org} for details on compilation, references, historical perspective on `ThermoGlobe`, and previous compilations. `ThermoGlobe` is the most recent database available, has been carefully compiled, and is open-access.

Like @lucazeau2019, `r format(sum(hf$code6 == 'D', na.rm = T), big.mark = ',')` poor quality observations (`Code 6` = D), `r sum(is.na(hf['hf']), na.rm = T)` data points without heat flow observations, and `r sum(is.na(hf$longitude), na.rm = T)+sum(is.na(hf$latitude), na.rm = T)` without geographic information are excluded from the analysis. Note that quality control of such a large dataset is an ongoing endeavor and `r format(sum(hf$code6=='Z', na.rm = T), big.mark=',')` observations currently have an undetermined quality (`Code 6` = Z). Duplicate observations at the same location are parsed (to avoid singular covariance matrices during Kriging) by selecting only the best quality measurement. If duplicate measurements are of equal quality, one is randomly chosen. Finally, only surface heat flow values in the range (0 - 250] $mWm^{-2}$ are included in Kriging. Surface heat flow observations outside of the range (0 - 250] $mWm^{-2}$ are considered anomalous [e.g. collected near geothermal systems, @lucazeau2019] and constitute a small fraction of measurements (`r format(nrow(hf[hf$hf < 0 | hf$hf > 250,]), big.mark = ',')` out of `r format(nrow(hf[hf$hf > 0 & hf$hf <= 250,]), big.mark = ',')`) forming long tails on either side of the global surface heat flow distribution. The final dataset used for Kriging contains `r format(nrow(hf.crop), big.mark=',')` observations after filtering for quality, missing values, and heat flow range, parsing `r format(n.dup,big.mark=',')` duplicate pairs, and cropping within subduction zone buffers (Table \@ref(tab:hfSummaryTable) & Figure \@ref(fig:hfSummaryPlot)).

(ref:hfSummaryPlotCap) Distribution of `ThermoGlobe` observations cropped within 1000 $km$ circular buffers around 13 active subduction zone segments. Heat flow distributions are centered between `r min(hf.summary$median)` and `r max(hf.summary$median)` $mWm^{-2}$ and highly skewed right. Skewness represents near-surface perturbations from geothermal systems and tectonic regions with high thermal activity. Diverse interactions between tectonic and near-surface processes are apparent from the broad, irregular surface heat flow distributions. Distributions are colored by quantiles (25%, 50%, 75%). Data from @lucazeau2019.

### Map Projection and Interpolation Grid

`ThermoGlobe` data and Similarity interpolations from @lucazeau2019 are transformed into a Pacific-centered Robinson coordinate reference system defined using the `proj4` string "`+proj=robin +lon_0=-155 +lon_wrap=-155 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs`" [@proj2021]. All geographic operations, including transformation, cropping, Kriging, and comparing interpolations, are performed in the above coordinate reference system using general-purpose functions in the `R` package `sf` [@pebesma2018]. The Kriging domains (Figure \@ref(fig:domainConstruct)) are defined by drawing 1000 $km$ circular buffers around each subduction zone segment defined by @syracuse2006. Target locations for Kriging are defined across the same grid used by @lucazeau2019 to compute point-by-point differences with their Similarity interpolation.

(ref:domainConstructCap) Example of a interpolation domain constructed around Kyushu Ryukyu. Interpolation domains are defined by drawing a 1000 $km$ circular buffer (thin black line) around the segment boundary (bold black line). `ThermoGlobe` data is cropped within the buffered region by intersection (left). Note that Kyushu Ryukyu is one of the most densely sampled regions, yet still has considerable gaps. Similarity interpolation (right) fills in the gaps and presents a textured distribution by combining many underlying geologic proxy datasets. Note that surface heat flow above 250 $mWm^{-2}$ is colored white. Data and interpolations from @lucazeau2019. Segment boundary defined by @syracuse2006.

### Kriging

Kriging is derived from the theory of *regionalized variables* [@matheron1963; @matheron2019], which formally defines a probabilistic framework for spatial interpolation of natural phenomena. In simple terms, Kriging approximates an unknown quantity as a linear combination of all nearby known quantities. Kriging is a three-step process that involves: 1) estimating an experimental variogram $\hat{\gamma}(h)$ which characterizes the spatial (dis)continuity of some quantity within the Kriging domain, 2) fitting one of many variogram models $\gamma(h)$ to the experimental variogram, and 3) directly solving a linear system of Kriging equations to estimate unknown quantities at arbitrary target locations [@krige1951; @cressie2015]. The general-purpose functions defined in the `R` package `gstat` [@graler2016; @pebesma2004] are used to perform all three Kriging steps. The first step is computing experimental variograms [after @bardossy1997]:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    &\hat{\gamma}(h) = \frac{1}{2N(h)}\sum_{N(h)}^{}[Z(u_i) - Z(u_j)]^2 \\
    &N(h) = \#\{h \  \in \  [h - \delta,\  h + \delta)\} \\
    &h = |u_i - u_j| \\
    &\delta = \frac{\max(h)}{n\ c}
  \end{aligned}
  (\#eq:variogram)
\end{equation}

where $Z(u_i)$ and $Z(u_j)$ are pairs of observations located at $u_i$ and $u_j$, $N(h)$ is the number of point-pairs separated by a lag distance, $h$, and $\delta$ is a binwidth used to evaluate $\hat{\gamma}(h)$ with irregularly spaced data. The binwidth is defined by computing the maximum lag distance among all point-pairs $\max(h)$ divided by the number of lags $n$ and a lag cutoff proportionality constant $c$. The binwidth $\delta$ is then multiplied by the sum of the number of lags $n$ and a horizontal lag shift constant $l$ to effectively shift $\hat{\gamma}(h)$ to the left proportionally to $l$. This is necessary to avoid negative ranges when fitting experimental variograms with anomalously high variances at small lag distances.

This study applies ordinary Kriging with isotropic variogram models to surface heat flow data projected onto a smooth sphere (neglecting elevation). Kriging is applied locally across larger domains (to avoid violating stationarity assumptions) by evaluating only the nearest $n_{max}$ point-pairs at each target location. Several variogram parameters influence the Kriging result, including the choice of variogram model, the scope of local Kriging $n_{max}$, and choice of experimental variogram parameters in Equation \@ref(eq:variogram). A constrained non-linear optimization approach is used to find optimum values for the parameters $\Theta = \{model,\ n,\ c,\ n_{max},\ l\}$. A weighted sum of \glspl{rmse} evaluated during variogram model fitting and Kriging is used as a cost function $C(\Theta) = w_{vgrm}\ C_{vgrm}(\Theta) + w_{interp}\ C_{interp}(\Theta)$ to simultaneously minimize variogram errors ($C_{vgrm}$) and Kriging errors [$C_{interp}$\, after @li2018]. The `R` package `nloptr` is used to optimize the cost function $C(\Theta)$. A full description of the Kriging system of equations, underlying assumptions, and optimization methods is presented in Appendix \@ref(krigeOpt). All experimental and fitted variograms are presented in Appendix \@ref(interpDiffAppendix).

## Results {#chpt3Results}

```{r vSum, include=FALSE}
v.opt <-
  vgrm.summary %>%
  filter(v.mod != 'Gau') %>%
  group_by(segment) %>%
  slice_min(cost) %>%
  select(-c(itr, vgrm.wt, vgrm.rmse, vgrm.cost, cv.wt, cv.cost))
```

### Kriging Parameters

Optimized Kriging parameters, cross-validation errors, and associated cost are given in Table \@ref(tab:vgrmSummaryTable) and Figure \@ref(fig:vgrmSummaryPlot) (see Appendix \@ref(krigeOpt) for details about the optimization procedure). Kriging parameters vary substantially from segment to segment but do not correlate with cost (with the possible exception of the variogram sill, Figure \@ref(fig:vgrmSummaryPlot)). Despite a range of domain sizes, observation densities, and diverse tectonic configurations, all Kriging domains converge on solutions within 15-20 iterations (Figure \@ref(fig:optTrace)) without noticeable patterns of error overall (Figure \@ref(fig:vgrmSummaryPlot)). Differences in cost are apparently explained by constant segment-to-segment differences in surface heat flow distributions ($\sigma_{vgrm}$, $\sigma_{interp}$, Equation \@ref(eq:costExp)) rather than differences in Kriging parameters. The variogram optimization methods are thus successfully generalizable across subduction zone segments without a need for case-by-case data manipulation or anisotropic variogram models.

```{r vgrmSummaryTable}
v.opt %>%
mutate(
  'cutoff.prop' = round(cutoff.prop, 1),
  'n.lags' = round(n.lags, 1),
  'lag.start' = round(lag.start, 1),
  'n.max' = round(n.max, 1),
  'sill' = round(sill),
  'range' = round(range/1000),
  'cv.rmse' = round(cv.rmse),
  'cost' = round(cost, 3)
) %>% 
kable(
  col.names = c('Segment', 'Model', 'Cutoff', 'Lags', 'Shift', '$n_{max}$', 'Sill', 'Range', 'RMSE', 'Cost'),
  caption = 'Optimum variogram models by segment',
  linesep = '',
  escape = F,
  booktabs = T,
  format = 'latex'
) %>%
kable_styling(latex_options = c('striped', 'scale_down')) %>%
kable_classic() %>%
footnote(
  general_title = '',
  general = c('\\\\uline{\\\\textit{note}}: Optimum model selected by minimum cost (excluding Gau models)', '\\\\uline{\\\\textit{key}}: $n_{max}$: max point-pairs for local Kriging, Sill $[(mWm^{-2})^2]$, Range $[km]$, RMSE: Krige cross-validation error $[mWm^{-2}]$, Cost $[mWm^{-2}]$'),
  threeparttable = T,
  escape = F
)
```

Kriging cross-validation errors are within `r round(min(v.opt$cv.rmse)-7)` (`r v.opt$segment[which.min(v.opt$cv.rmse)]`) to `r round(max(v.opt$cv.rmse)-7)` (`r v.opt$segment[which.max(v.opt$cv.rmse)]`) $mWm^{-2}$ of the quoted 7 $mWm^{-2}$ \gls{rmse} for @lucazeau2019's preferred Similarity model (7 proxy observables, Table \@ref(tab:vgrmSummaryTable)). As expected, Kriging errors can be relatively small compared to Similarity for domains with high observation density (`r v.opt$segment[which.min(v.opt$cv.rmse)]`; n = `r format(nrow(shp.hf.crop[[v.opt$segment[which.min(v.opt$cv.rmse)]]]), big.mark = ',')`) but relatively large where observational density is comparatively low (`r v.opt$segment[which.max(v.opt$cv.rmse)]`; n = `r format(nrow(shp.hf.crop[[v.opt$segment[which.max(v.opt$cv.rmse)]]]), big.mark = ',')`). Please note, however, that Kriging error is evaluated only on observations within 1000 $km$ buffers of subduction zone segments. The quoted 7 $mWm^{-2}$ \gls{rmse} from @lucazeau2019 evaluates error on surface heat flow observations across all oceans and continents. Differentiating \glspl{rmse} in Table \@ref(tab:vgrmSummaryTable) from errors reported by @lucazeau2019 [or other global interpolations: e.g. @goutorbe2011; @pollack1993; @shapiro2004] are therefore only rough comparisons. It is unclear how Similarity uncertainty will scale overall when the domain is restricted to regional tectonic scales.

```

Two point-by-point comparisons between Similarity and Kriging methods are presented in this study---*estimates* and *uncertainties*. Summary statistics for *estimate* differences are given in Table \@ref(tab:diffSummaryTable). Summary statistics for *uncertainty* differences are given in Appendix \@ref(interpDiffAppendix).

```{r diffSummaryTable}
interp.diff %>%
kable(
  col.names = c('Segment', 'Model', 'Min', 'Max', 'Median', 'IQR', 'Mean', '$\\sigma$', 'n', 'Cost'),
  caption = '[Similarity $-$ Krige] estimate differences by segment',
  linesep = '',
  escape = F,

  format = 'latex'
) %>%

  threeparttable = T,
  escape = F
)
```

Differences between Similarity and Kriging estimates are centered near zero with median differences ranging from `r min(interp.diff$median)` to `r max(interp.diff$median)` $mWm^{-2}$, but broadly distributed with interquartile ranges from `r min(interp.diff$IQR)` to `r max(interp.diff$IQR)` $mWm^{-2}$ and long tails extending from `r min(interp.diff$min)` to `r max(interp.diff$max)` $mWm^{-2}$. Interpolation methods generally agree to within a few tens of $mWm^{-2}$ on average (Figure \@ref(fig:diffSummaryPlot)). Distributions of estimate differences are either approximately symmetrical, or skewed right. Right skew and a tendency of medians to deviate positively from zero indicate a systematic overestimation of surface heat flow by the Similarity method compared to Kriging (Figure \@ref(fig:diffSummaryPlot)). The exception is Tonga New Zealand which has a slight negative median. Please note, however, that Kriging is applied to observations within the range (0 - 250] $mWm^{-2}$, whereas Similarity uses the entire `ThermoGlobe` dataset (filtered for quality). While this may explain some of the long positive tails in Figure \@ref(fig:diffSummaryPlot), it does not significantly affect the overall distributions of estimate differences as relatively few `ThermoGlobe` observations fall outside of (0 - 250] $mWm^{-2}$ (`r format(nrow(hf[hf$hf < 0 | hf$hf > 250,]), big.mark = ',')` out of `r format(nrow(hf[hf$hf > 0 & hf$hf <= 250,]), big.mark = ',')`).

The broad distributions of estimate differences likely arise from contrasting assumptions underlying either interpolation method. Kriging tends to spatially smooth out surface heat flow gradients, whereas Similarity is agnostic to gradients and may present very textured interpolations. Comparison between Krige and Similarity interpolations may appear similar across the interpolation domain on average, but with subtle differences at the grid-step scale. The broadest distributions (e.g. `r interp.diff$segment[which.max(interp.diff$IQR)]`), however, point to less subtle differences between methods (examples given in Section \@ref(regionalDiff)).

(ref:diffSummaryPlotCap) Summary of differences between Similarity and Kriging estimates. Note that differences are computed as [Similarity $-$ Krige]. Differences are centered near zero with medians ranging from `r min(interp.diff$median)` to `r max(interp.diff$median)` $mWm^{-2}$, but broadly distributed with interquartile ranges from `r min(interp.diff$IQR)` to `r max(interp.diff$IQR)` $mWm^{-2}$ and long tails extending from `r min(interp.diff$min)` to `r max(interp.diff$max)` $mWm^{-2}$. Interpolation methods generally agree to within a few tens of $mWm^{-2}$ near subduction zone segments. Positive medians and right skew indicate systematic overestimation of surface heat flow by Similarity compared to Kriging. The broadest distributions (Andes and Central America) reflect less subtle differences between methods. Distributions are colored by quantiles (25%, 50%, 75%). Similarity estimates from @lucazeau2019. Please refer to Figure \@ref(fig:sigmaDiffSummaryPlot) for uncertainty differences.

### Regional Interpolation Differences {#regionalDiff}

Notable sources of differences between Similarity and Kriging methods include 1) tectonic features resolved by Similarity that are smoothed-out by Kriging or 2) general discordance between the spatial continuity of surface heat flow observations and Similarity estimates. Examples given in this section highlight the range of differences observed between Similarity and Kriging methods in diverse interpolation domains. These include complex tectonic environments (Central America, Vanuatu), simple tectonic environments (Kyushyu Ryukyu), and regions with very few observations (Scotia). All other segments are in Appendix \@ref(interpDiffAppendix).

For example, high surface heat flow representing the arms of the Galápagos triple junction are resolved by Similarity to the SW of the Central America segment (Figure \@ref(fig:centralAmericaDiff)). However, the triple junction arms are not well defined by Kriging. The interpolation comparison for Central America highlights two distinct regions---bright positive differences along the arms of the triple junction and within the subducting Cocos Plate, and muted differences to the E and NE of the Cocos Plate behind the volcanic arc. Note the moderate differences within the Cocos Plate in Figure \@ref(fig:centralAmericaDiff) where Similarity estimates relatively high surface heat flow by proximity to the nearby spreading centers. Kriging estimates in the same region disagree because surface heat flow observations within the Cocos Plate are, in fact, relatively low. Similar discordance between high Similarity estimates and low surface heat flow observations are observed in many subduction zone segments, especially near spreading centers.

In contrast, estimate and uncertainty differences between Similarity and Kriging are small and narrowly distributed near Kyushu Ryukyu (median difference: `r interp.diff$median[interp.diff$segment == 'Kyushu Ryukyu']`, IQR: `r interp.diff$IQR[interp.diff$segment == 'Kyushu Ryukyu']` $mWm^{-2}$) compared to Central America (median difference: `r interp.diff$median[interp.diff$segment == 'Central America']`, IQR: `r interp.diff$IQR[interp.diff$segment == 'Central America']` $mWm^{-2}$). Kyushyu Ryukyu has has a comparable number of observations (n = `r format(nrow(shp.hf.crop[['Kyushu Ryukyu']]), big.mark = ',')`) as Central America (n = `r format(nrow(shp.hf.crop[['Central America']]), big.mark = ',')`), but a simpler tectonic configuration (no spreading centers) and more regularly spaced observations. Kriging near Kyushu Ryukyu resolves much of the texture seen in the Similarity interpolation (Figure \@ref(fig:kyushuRyukyuDiff)). Similarity and Kriging evidently converge in this case by a combination of adequate observation density and spatial coverage. However, it is nontrivial to suggest minimum thresholds constituting "adequate" observation density or spatial coverage. General guidelines may be developed, but Kriging results must still be evaluated *a posteriori*.

The Scotia segment illustrates a case where surface heat flow observations are incredibly sparse. Similarity resolves the East Scotia Ridge (ESR) and the WSW-ENE trending transform boundary separating the Scotia and Sandwich Plates from the Antartic Plate (Figure \@ref(fig:scotiaDiff)). Kriging, on the other hand, appears featureless because very few surface heat flow observations (n = `r nrow(shp.hf.crop[['Scotia']])`) poorly define experimental variograms. Kriging estimates thus approximate the expected (mean: `r hf.summary$mean[hf.summary$segment == 'Scotia']` $mWm^{-2}$) value for the entire domain according to Equation \@ref(eq:linEstimate). That is, Kriging provides no more geodynamic information than computing the arithmetic mean for surface heat flow observations within 1000 $km$ of the Scotia segment. Resolving spatial (dis)continuity is unfeasible and Similarity methods become the obvious choice in such cases.

While Similarity tends to define tectonic features and Kriging tends to smooth out tectonic features, the opposite pattern is observed within the tectonically-complex region near Vanuatu. Similarity resolves the N-S trending spreading center separating the New Hebrides plate from the Balmoral Reef and Conway Reef microplates (Figure \@ref(fig:vanuatuDiff)). However, surface heat flow observations are sufficiently dense and continuous to partially resolve the short ridge segments and transform faults outlining the microplates between Vanuatu and the Tonga New Zealand segments by Kriging. The differences are difficult to interpret because of the somewhat random discordance between interpolation methods.

(ref:centralAmericaDiffCap) Similarity vs. Kriging estimates and uncertainties for Central America. Arms of the Galápagos triple junction (GTJ), the East Pacific Rise (EPR) and Cocos Ridge (CR), are resolved by Similarity (topleft), but smoothed-out by Kriging (topright). Note the moderate positive differences between estimates within the Cocos Plate (CP) where Similarity estimates relatively high surface heat flow, but surface heat flow observations are low (bottomleft). Patterns in uncertainty differences generally reflect observation density. Note that computed differences off the colorbar scale in the bottom plots are colored grey.

## Discussion

### Interpolation Approaches

The two interpolation approaches compared in this Chapter are fundamentally based on different underlying assumptions encapsulated by the First and Third Laws of Geography. Kriging is based on the First Law: *everything is related, but nearer things are more related* [@krige1951]. Similarity is based on the Third Law: *two points with similar geographic configurations should have similar values* [@zhu2018]. The comparisons in Section \@ref(chpt3Results) provide new context for researchers interested in using surface heat flow to investigate subduction zone geodynamics. While one approach is not evidently favorable in principle, Similarity produces more accurate interpolations in practice (at the scale and scope of active subduction zones), especially in cases with low observation density and irregularly-spacing.

Similarity generally produces interpolations that resolve discrete tectonic features (spreading centers and large fault systems) with detailed regional texture (see Appendix \@ref(interpDiffAppendix)). The texture is artificial insofar as it does not represent actual spatial changes in surface heat flow, but appears to be geodynamically consistent across all 13 active subduction zone considered in this study. The success of the Similarity approach comes from integration of multiple sources of geologic information---carefully compiled and combined into a composite estimate of surface heat flow. Combining several (or dozens of) proxy datasets may be more meticulous than ordinary Kriging, yet Similarity works reliably well across all 13 active subduction zone segments. Kriging estimates, on the other hand, provide no additional information beyond simple arithmetic means for subduction zone segments that lack sufficient observation density (e.g. Scotia, Figure \@ref(fig:scotiaDiff)). While some use cases may exist for Kriging's inherent smoothing effect, geodynamically-consistent estimates of surface heat flow near subduction zones are likely more desirable in most cases.

Two inconsistencies with the Similarity approach are noted, however. First, Similarity systematically overestimates surface heat flow compared to Kriging (Figure \@ref(fig:diffSummaryPlot)). This may be partially explained by the restricted range ((0 - 250] $mWm^{-2}$) of `ThermoGlobe` observations used for Kriging. Or it may represent skewed distributions or overweighting of some proxies used in the Similarity interpolation method (e.g. proximity to spreading centers, Figure \@ref(fig:centralAmericaDiff)). Second, known features within the tectonically-complex region near Vanuatu may be better resolved by Kriging than Similarity. It is important to note, however, that Vanuatu is the only case where Kriging resolves tectonic features that Similarity does not; the trend is otherwise opposite. Moreover, the inconsistencies near Vanuatu do not imply algorithmic issues with Similarity and can likely be resolved by using a finer-scale grid.

The most important inconsistencies to evaluate, regardless of interpolation method, are general discordance between estimates and observations (e.g. with \gls{rmse}). Disagreements with observations imply failures of the underlying Geographic Laws, which are not easily correctable algorithmically in a generalized sense. Similarity is demonstrably successful at achieving low error rates at the global-scale even when randomly combining proxies [@lucazeau2019]. Assuming error rates for Similarity interpolations constrained to regional scales (e.g. near subduction zone segments) are consistent with \glspl{rmse} reported by @lucazeau2019 for global scales, Similarity is on average `r round(min(v.opt$cv.rmse)/7)` to `r round(max(v.opt$cv.rmse)/7)` times more accurate than simple ordinary Kriging (compare 7 $mWm^{-2}$  Similarity \gls{rmse} to Kriging \glspl{rmse} in Table \@ref(tab:vgrmSummaryTable)). This is sound basis for presently favoring Similarity over Kriging across subduction zone segment scales. Exceptions may include regions with high observation density and spatial coverage, or regions that are far beneath the resolution of global proxy datasets (approximately $0.5^\circ \times 0.5^\circ$) used for Similarity [@goutorbe2011; @lucazeau2019].

Regardless of methodology, the accuracy and resolution of interpolations compared in this study are enough to probe hypotheses about regional geodynamic (in)consistencies among active subduction zones. Similarity and Kriging interpolations qualitatively show diverse patterns in surface heat flow among subduction zone segments. Diverse patterns in surface heat flow may imply spatially heterogeneous lithospheric thickness (contrary to expectations from Chapter \@ref(chpt2)), spatially heterogeneous dynamics, spatially heterogeneous near-surface perturbations, and/or undersampling relative to the scale and magnitude of spatial variability. Please note, however, that spatially continuous surface heat flow patterns also appear across subduction zone segments (e.g. Sumatra Banda Sea, see Appendix \@ref(interpDiffAppendix)). At present, cautious interpretations of subduction zone geodynamics on the basis of spatial surface heat flow patterns are encouraged. Scaling datasets and developing composite interpolation approaches (e.g. layering Similarity + Kriging + $\cdots$) promises better tools for scrutinizing differences among regional tectonic domains.

### 1D vs. 2D Spatial Variability

Testing hypotheses relating to subduction zone geodynamics requires careful sampling of surface heat flow in order to apply statistical models. Previous studies commonly use a four-part sampling strategy: 1) draw a cross-section line perpendicular to a trench, 2) draw a rectangle with arbitrary width encompassing the section line, 3) gather all surface heat flow observations within the rectangle, and 4) project the gathered observations onto the section line [e.g. @currie2004; @currie2006; @hyndman2005; @wada2009]. This sampling strategy is simple and effective if measurements along section lines are equally spaced with high spatial density. However, the strategy has two major limitations. First, the First Law of Geography is increasingly violated with the size of the sampling rectangle as more disparate points are projected onto the section line for comparison. Second, transects characterize surface heat flow patterns within a narrow scope, and do not consider spatial variability in 2D (along strike in map view).

Hypotheses such as uniformly thin upper-plate lithospheres (Chapter \@ref(chpt2)) and depths of plate coupling among subduction zones [@currie2004; @currie2006; @furukawa1993; @kerswell2020; @wada2009] are inferred from 1D sampling strategies like the one described above. However, the true extent of such characterizations of subduction zone geodynamics is yet to be evaluated in 2D. Similarity and Kriging interpolations in Section \@ref(chpt3Results) show spatial variability in surface heat flow that appear to contradict such claims of uniformity within, or among, subduction zone segments. Insofar as surface heat flow can answer questions about subduction zone geodynamics, claims of broad uniformity among active subduction zones are better qualified with observations that characterize the spatial variability of surface heat flow to the fullest extent possible.

## Conclusions

This study uses ordinary Kriging to interpolate global surface heat flow observations sampled within 1000 $km$ buffers of 13 active subduction zone segments. Kriging interpolations are directly compared to Similarity interpolations within the same domains to evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of each technique in distinguishing spatial patterns of surface heat flow near subduction zones. Differences between interpolation estimates and uncertainties highlight four important points of consideration:

1. Similarity and Kriging methods produce broadly comparable results, but Similarity interpolations are favored for their lower error rates and geodynamically-consistent results across all 13 subduction zone segments
2. Interpolations show diverse 2D spatial patterns of (dis)continuous surface heat flow, encouraging cautious interpretations of subsurface geodynamics without characterizing surface heat flow distributions to the fullest extent possible
3. Dataset scaling and composite interpolation approaches promise better tools for evaluating geodynamic diversity within, and among, subduction zone segments and is proposed for future research

## Abstract {#chpt4Abstract}

\Glsfirst{hp} metamorphic rocks that are detached (recovered) from subducting oceanic-plates and exhumed to the Earth's surface become invaluable records of pressure-temperature-strain fields deep in subduction zones. For example, comparing metamorphic \glsfirst{ptt} estimates from suites of \gls{hp} rocks allows for evaluation of \gls{pt} gradients along the plate interface through time. However, some incongruent interpretations concerning \gls{pt} gradients, recovery rates, and recovery depths arise when comparing globally aggregated \gls{ptt} estimates with \gls{pt} gradients from numerical geodynamic models. This study evaluates marker recovery in numerical simulations of oceanic-continental convergence across a range of initial thermo-kinematic boundary conditions representing presently active subduction zones. Over one-million markers traced from 64 simulated subduction zones are classified as recovered, or lost, by implementing a soft clustering classification algorithm. Marker \gls{ptt} distributions are compared across models and with the rock record to address the following questions. How do recovery rates vary among subduction zones? How is recovery distributed along the plate interface, and how does it vary among subduction zones and through time? Marker \gls{ptt} distributions and recovery rates show sensitivity to oceanic-plate age, convergence velocity, and relative detachment timing, but not to upper-plate lithospheric thickness. Marker \gls{ptt} distributions are distinct from the rock record across all but the slowest-converging (40 $km/Ma$) simulations. Four geodynamic regimes with different recovery modes are recognized and discussed with implications for interpreting the rock record. This study highlights the immediate usefulness of augmenting observational constraints with a large (`r format(nrow(fts.summary[fts.summary$rec,]), big.mark = ',')`) simulated dataset.

## Introduction {#chpt4Intro}

Maximum metamorphic conditions, in terms of \glsfirst{pt}, have been estimated for hundreds of \glsfirst{hp} rocks exhumed from subduction zones [Figure \@ref(fig:pd15), @agard2018; @penniston2015]. Aggregated suites of \gls{hp} rocks (the *rock record*) are the only tangible record of pressure-temperature-strain fields experienced by Earth's lithosphere during deformation and chemical processing in subduction zones [e.g. @agard2009; @agard2018; @penniston2015]. Together with geophysical imaging [e.g. @ferris2003; @naif2015; @hyndman2003; @syracuse2006; @rondenay2008], surface heat flow [e.g. Chapter \@ref(chpt3), @currie2006; @gao2014; @wada2009; @hyndman2005], and forward numerical modelling [e.g. @gerya2008; @gerya2002; @sizova2010; @gerya2006; @syracuse2010; @yamato2007; @yamato2008; @hacker2003; @peacock1990; @peacock1996; @mckenzie1969], the rock record underpins contemporary understandings of subduction zone geodynamics [e.g. @agard2009; @agard2018; @bebout2007].

What geodynamic information can be extracted from the rock record? Previous work comparing \gls{pt} distributions of \gls{hp} rocks with numerical geodynamic models identifies two key observations. First, global \gls{pt} estimates compiled by @penniston2015 (the `pd15` dataset) reveal a kinked \gls{cdf} with respect to pressure (Figure \@ref(fig:pd15)). A change in \gls{cdf} slope around `r round(tail(pd15$pressure[pd15$cumulative <= 0.8], 1), 1)` $GPa$ implies relatively uniform recovery of oceanic material up to `r round(tail(pd15$pressure[pd15$cumulative <= 0.8], 1), 1)` $GPa$, but increasingly rare recovery above `r round(tail(pd15$pressure[pd15$cumulative <= 0.8], 1), 1)` $GPa$ [@agard2018; @kerswell2020]. Note that eclogites recovered from extreme pressures above approximately 3 $GPa$ generally have felsic compositions and typify deep subduction of continental material exhumed immediately preceding continental collision [@agard2018]. While evidence of uniform mechanical coupling depths among presently active subduction zones near 2.3 $GPa$ [@currie2006; @furukawa1993; @wada2009; @kerswell2020] is consistent with a relative probability decrease above `r round(tail(pd15$pressure[pd15$cumulative <= 0.8], 1), 1)` $GPa$ implied by `pd15`'s \gls{cdf}, Chapter \@ref(chpt3) shows evidence from 2D interpolations of surface heat flow in contradiction of uniform coupling depths. Moreover, it is unclear if `pd15`'s \gls{cdf} implies a shift in the probability of *recovery* or *exhumation* of oceanic material from around `r round(tail(pd15$pressure[pd15$cumulative <= 0.8], 1), 1)` $GPa$, or perhaps a simpler explanation such as sampling bias (i.e. more greenschists and blueschists have been studied relative to (ultra-)\gls{hp} rocks).

Second, \gls{hp} rocks recovered from pressures of $\leq$ 2 $GPa$ generally record higher temperatures than estimated by some numerical experiments [@penniston2015]. Potential explanations for non-overlapping \gls{pt} distributions among \gls{hp} rocks and numerical models include choice of thermo-kinematic boundary conditions for numerical experiments (oceanic-plate age, convergence velocity, subduction dip angle, upper-plate thickness, heating sources, etc.), differential exhumation of \gls{hp} rocks from subduction zones with higher average \gls{pt} gradients, and comparisons among suites of undifferentiated \gls{hp} rocks with variable relative detachment timing [@penniston2015; @abers2017; @kohn2018; @agard2018; @vankeken2019]. Please note, however, that many comparisons among diverse numerical experiments and metamorphic terranes show various extents of agreement depending on one's choice of initial thermo-kinematic boundary conditions and preferred suite(s) of \gls{hp} rocks [@yamato2007; @yamato2008; @roda2010; @angiboust2012b; @roda2012; @burov2014; @ruh2015; @plunder2018; @roda2020; @holt2021]. Such assorted conclusions warrant further investigation into the general response of \gls{ptt} distributions to broad ranges of thermo-kinematic boundary conditions.

(ref:pd15Cap) \gls{pt} estimates from the rock record. Maximum metamorphic conditions for exhumed \gls{hp} rocks (left; n = `r nrow(pd15)`) roughly fall within thermal gradients from 5 $K/km$ to 20 $K/km$ (thin black lines; calculated with a lithostatic gradient of 35 $km/GPa$). \gls{pt} estimates are concentrated along a high-probability ridgeline that drops off sharply above `r round(tail(pd15$pressure[pd15$cumulative <= 0.8], 1), 1)` $GPa$ (colored contours; calculated with a 2D Gaussian kernel). The \gls{cdf} (right) shows the relative probability of rock recovery explicitly with respect to pressure. Note the shared y-axis. The long ridgeline (left) and change in \gls{cdf} slope at `r round(tail(pd15$pressure[pd15$cumulative <= 0.8], 1), 1)` $GPa$ (right) imply uniform recovery of greenschists and blueschists up to `r round(tail(pd15$pressure[pd15$cumulative <= 0.8], 1), 1)` $GPa$, but increasingly rare eclogite recovery from depths $\geq$ `r round(tail(pd15$pressure[pd15$cumulative <= 0.8], 1), 1)` $GPa$. Data from @penniston2015.

```{r pd15, fig.cap='(ref:pd15Cap)', fig.scap='\\gls{pt} estimates from the rock record'}

include_graphics('assets/figs/chpt4/pd15.png')

```

Two hypotheses regarding mechanical processing of oceanic material in subduction zones follow from the above observations:

> 1. The probability of recovering \gls{hp} rocks is relatively uniform up to `r round(tail(pd15$pressure[pd15$cumulative <= 0.8], 1), 1)` $GPa$ (null: recovery is non-uniform with depth)
>
> 2. Recovery rates of \gls{hp} rocks vary with thermo-kinematic boundary conditions (null: recovery rates are not different among subduction zone)

These hypotheses aim at important questions in subduction zone research. Are \gls{hp} rocks recovered broadly along the plate interface or discretely? Are \gls{hp} rocks differentially recovered from subduction zones with favorable thermo-kinematic boundary conditions or is recovery ubiquitous among subduction zones? How do recovery rates change across diverse subduction zones?

The primary obstacle in addressing such questions is differentiating an unrestrained number of possible forward models with relatively few (dozens) \gls{ptt} estimates from any particular exhumed \gls{hp} metamorphic terrane. In other words, there is an imbalance between the size and scope of possible subduction zone models and the size and scope of observational constraints. This Chapter addresses the problem by augmenting observational constraints with a large (`r format(nrow(fts.summary[fts.summary$rec,]), big.mark = ',')`) simulated \gls{ptt} dataset. More than one million markers are traced from 64 numerical experiments representing the range of thermo-kinematic boundary conditions for presently active oceanic-continental margins [experiments from Chapter \@ref(chpt2), @kerswell2020; @syracuse2006; @wada2009]. Traced markers are classified as recovered, or lost, according to characteristics of their \gls{ptt} paths using a soft clustering classification algorithm. \gls{pt} distributions of markers appear sensitive to convergence rate and oceanic-plate age, but insensitive to upper-plate thickness (contrary to expectations from Chapter \@ref(chpt2)). Further, recovery rates are strongly dependent on initial thermo-kinematic boundary conditions, characterized by the thermal parameter $\Phi$. Four distinct geodynamic regimes are identified and their implications are discussed for interpreting aggregate \gls{pt} datasets like `pd15`.


## Methods {#chpt4Methods}

This study presents a dataset of Lagrangian markers (described below) from the numerical experiments in Chapter \@ref(chpt2) [@kerswell2020]. The experiments simulate 64 oceanic-continental convergent margins with thermo-kinematic boundary conditions (oceanic-plate age, convergence velocity, and upper-plate lithospheric thickness) that generally represent the range of presently active subduction zones [@syracuse2006; @wada2009]. Initial conditions were modified from previous studies of active margins [@sizova2010; @gorczyk2007]. The code `I2VIS` models visco-plastic flow of geologic materials by solving three conservative equations of mass, energy, and momentum on a fully-staggered finite difference grid with a *marker-in-cell* technique [@gerya2003; @harlow1965]. Further details about the initial setup, boundary conditions, and rheologic model are in Chapter \@ref(chpt2) and Appendix \@ref(deHydration) [@kerswell2020]. Details about the marker-in-cell technique are in @gerya2003 and @gerya2019.

This section defines Lagrangian markers (now referred to as markers) and briefly elaborates on their usefulness in understanding fluid flow, followed by a description of the marker classification algorithm. Mathematical details on classification are in Appendix \@ref(gmm).

### Lagrangian Markers

Markers are mathematical objects representing discrete parcels of fluid flowing in a continuum [@harlow1962; @harlow1964]. Tracing markers (saving marker information at each timestep) is distinctly advantageous for investigating subduction dynamics in the following two ways.

First, under a set of assumptions, tracing markers is like tracing a rock's \gls{ptt} history. Assumptions in this study include an incompressible continuum [@batchelor1953; @boussinesq1897], a petrologic model governing marker material properties [@ito1971; @schmidt1998], and a highly non-linear rheologic model relating stress and strain by empirical flow laws [@hilairet2007; @ranalli1995; @karato1993; @turcotte2002]. Insofar as Earth's lithosphere behave like an incompressible visco-plastic fluid [under the assumptions above, @gerya2019; @kerswell2020; @gerya2003], comparisons between marker \gls{ptt} paths and the rock record may be made.

Second, markers deform in a partly layered, partly heterogeneous, high-strain region known as the *plate interface*, *subduction interface*, or *subduction channel* [@gerya2002]. Current conceptual models of the plate interface epitomize a visco-plastic continuum with complex geometry and structure, sharp thermal, chemical, and strain gradients, strong advection, and abundant fluid flow [@agard2016; @agard2018; @bebout2002; @bebout2007; @gerya2003; @syracuse2010; @penniston2015]. Because finite-difference numerical approaches do not perform well with strong local gradients, interpolating and updating temperature, strain, and chemical fields with markers greatly improves accuracy and stability of numerical solutions [@gerya2003; @gerya2019; @moresi2003].

### Maker Classification

On average, `r format(round(mean(class.summary$n)), big.mark = ',')` markers are initially selected from within a 760 $km$ wide and 8 $km$ deep section of oceanic crust and seafloor sediments at $t$ = 0 $Ma$. Tracing proceeds for 79 timesteps, which is sufficient for most markers to be deeply subducted ($\geq$ 200 $km$) from their initial positions. However, only markers recovered from the subducting oceanic-plate are relevant for comparison with \gls{pt} estimates of natural rocks. The main challenge, therefore, is to first determine which markers among `r format(nrow(fts.summary), big.mark = ',')` detach and move away from the subducting plate without knowing their fate *a priori*.

Classifying markers as either *recovered* or *lost* based solely on their undifferentiated traced histories defines an unsupervised classification problem [@barlow1989]. This study implements a Gaussian mixture model [Appendix \@ref(gmm), @reynolds2009], which is a type of "soft" clustering algorithm used extensively to solve such problems. In this case, Gaussian mixture model organizes markers into groups (clusters) by fitting $k=10$ bivariate Gaussian distributions to their maximum \gls{pt} (attained at depths of at least 20 $km$; maximum P and T are considered independently). "Fitting" refers to adjusting parameters of all $k$ Gaussians (centroids and covariance matrices) until the Gaussian ellipsoids and data achieve maximum likelihood (see Appendix \@ref(gmm)). Groups of markers are then labeled as either *recovered* or *lost* based on cluster centroid locations in \gls{pt} space and other simple rules given in Table \@ref(tab:rules).

  Rule = seq_len(7),

(ref:classCap) Example of marker classification for model cdf78. Clustering assigns `r format(round(class.summary$n[class.summary$model == 'cdf78']), big.mark = ',')` markers (squares) into ten classes according to their maximum \gls{pt} relative to all other markers (left). The size of cluster centroids (triangles) are proportional to the number of markers in a class. Markers belonging to clusters with centroids that have average \gls{pt} gradients greater than 5 $K/km$ (plotting to the right of the thin black line labelled "5") classify as recovered. Additional rules are applied to (re)classify individual markers (right; see Table \@ref(tab:rules)). Thin black lines are average \gls{pt} gradients of 5 $K/km$ and 20 $K/km$ (calculated with a lithostatic gradient of 35 $km/GPa$).

```

Please note that classification is possible by directly applying simple rules without clustering [e.g. markers reach a max depth of $Z$ before returning to a depth of $Z-dZ$, @roda2010]. This is an example of "hard" classification that assigns binary labels (marker is either recovered or lost), which is generally less flexible than "soft" approaches like Gaussian mixture model that assign probabilities (maker is 85% likely recovered, 15% likely lost). Similar approaches using Gaussian mixture model are broadly used in many scientific fields for pattern recognition, anomaly detection, and estimating complex probability distribution functions [e.g. @banfield1993; @celeux1995; @figueiredo2002; @fraley2002; @vermeesch2018]. Moreover, clustering methods (Appendix \@ref(gmm)) may be generally adopted to distinguish many possible feature(s) in geodynamic numerical models with Lagrangian reference frames. Figure \@ref(fig:class) shows an example of marker classification for 1 of 64 numerical experiments. All other experiments are in Appendix \@ref(vis).

## Results {#chpt4Results}

### PT Distributions of Recovered Markers

Markers compiled from all numerical experiments show distinct patterns of probability density and absolute \gls{pt} compared to `pd15` (Figure \@ref(fig:meta)). Marker density is asymmetric and bimodal with a high-probability peak around 1 $GPa$ (lower-blueschist to upper-greenschist facies) and a modest probability hill aroung 2.5 $GPa$ (upper-blueschist to eclogite facies). The probability density distribution of `pd15`, in contrast, is slightly shifted towards higher \gls{pt} gradients overall and is more uniformly distributed along a high-probability ridgeline spanning from 0.8 to 2.4 $GPa$ (upper-greenschist to lower-eclogite facies). \gls{hp} rocks recovered from 0.8 $GPa$ to 2.4 $GPa$ are especially overrepresented in `pd15` compared to markers compiled from all numerical experiments (Figure \@ref(fig:meta)).

(ref:metaCap) \gls{pt} distribution of recovered markers from all simulations. Maximum \gls{pt} for `r format(nrow(fts.summary[fts.summary$rec,]), big.mark = ',')` recovered markers compiled from all 64 subduction zone simulations (left; colored contours) show an asymmetric, bimodal distribution with a high-probability peak around 1 $GPa$ (upper-greenschist to lower-blueschist facies) and a modest probability hill around 2.5 $GPa$ (upper-blueschist to eclogite facies). Recovered markers neither completely overlap with the rock record (`pd15`; light grey density contours) in absolute \gls{pt} nor in terms of probability density. The \gls{cdf} (right) shows markers recovered between approximately 0.8 and 2.4 $GPa$ (greenschists to upper-blueschist) are especially overrepresented in the rock record (`pd15`; grey line) compared to simulations (black line). Rocks with maximum pressures above 2.4 $GPa$ (eclogites) are also overrepresented in the rock record (to a lesser degree) compared to simulations. Note that the gap between the grey and black lines (right) represents the relative difference in abundance of recovered material between `pd15` and simulations. Thin black lines are average \gls{pt} gradients of 5 $K/km$ and 20 $K/km$ (calculated with a lithostatic gradient of 35 $km/GPa$).

To better understand how rock recovery varies among subduction zones, marker \gls{pt} distributions are visualized in terms of convergence velocity (Figure \@ref(fig:cvDensity)), oceanic-plate age (Figure \@ref(fig:ageDensity)), upper-plate lithospheric thickness (Figure \@ref(fig:zupDensity)), and relative detachment timing (Figure \@ref(fig:detachDensity)).

Convergence velocity exhibits the strongest effect on marker \gls{pt} distributions. Markers recovered from the slowest-converging simulations (40 $km/Ma$) are more uniformly distributed across a wide band of metamorphic facies from approximately 0.8 to 3 $GPa$ (lower-greenschist to eclogite facies) compared to faster-converging simulations (Figure \@ref(fig:cvDensity)). The broadly skewed probability ridgeline exhibited by the slowest-converging models is most similar to `pd15`'s broad bimodal probability ridgeline in the sense that markers are recovered with relative frequency across a broad range of pressures. These \gls{pt} distributions contrast with faster-converging simulations that have more discrete, segregated, high-probability regions with a stronger majority components of \gls{hp} markers recovered around 1 $GPa$ (upper-greenschist to blueschist facies). Simulations with convergence velocities $\geq$ 66 $km/Ma$ also appear to have significant gaps in recovery between approximately 1.5 to 2.5 $GPa$ (blueschist and eclogite facies) and higher average \gls{pt} gradients. Please note, however, that simulations with $\geq$ 66 $km/Ma$ convergence rates are most similar with `pd15` if only comparing absolute \gls{pt} distributions.

(ref:cvDensityCap) \gls{pt} distribution of recovered markers by convergence velocity (panel headers = $km/Ma$). Marker \gls{pt} distributions (colored contours) are remarkably different for the lowest-convergence simulations (topleft; 40 $km/Ma$) compared to all other convergence rates ($\geq$ 66 $km/Ma$). The slowest-converging simulations recover fewer markers (distribution is smoother) along lower average \gls{pt} gradients, and have more uniform probability density across pressures $\geq$ 2 $GPa$. Faster-converging simulations ($\geq$ 66 $km/Ma$) show more segregated distributions with significant gaps in recovery around 2 $GPa$ (blueschist facies). The rock record (`pd15`; light grey contours) is most consistent with slow convergence ($<$ 66 $km/Ma$) in terms of probability density but more consistent with the faster convergence ($\geq$ 66 $km/Ma$) in terms of absolute \gls{pt}. An apparent threshold and geodynamic shift exists between velocities of 40 to 66 $km/Ma$. Thin black lines are average \gls{pt} gradients of 5 $K/km$ and 20 $K/km$ (calculated with a lithostatic gradient of 35 $km/GPa$).

#### Oceanic-plate Age Effect

Oceanic-plate age has the second strongest effect on marker \gls{pt} distributions, although the effect is relatively small compared to convergence velocity. Older oceanic-plates recover fewer markers from slightly higher average pressures than younger oceanic-plates (Figure \@ref(fig:ageDensity)). Significant gaps in the abundances of moderate-P and (ultra-)\gls{hp} rocks appear in simulations across oceanic-plate ages, except for simulations with 85 $Ma$ plates. Oceanic-plates $\geq$ 85 $Ma$ are most consistent with `pd15`, but still very distinct.

(ref:ageDensityCap) \gls{pt} distribution of recovered markers by oceanic-plate age (panel headers = $Ma$). Marker \gls{pt} distributions (colored contours) show a trend towards lower recovery rates (smoother contours), a shift towards higher average pressures, and more uniform probability density across 1.5 to 2.5 $GPa$ (lower-blueschist to lower-eclogite facies) with increasing oceanic-plate age. The rock record (`pd15`; light grey contours) generally agrees more with older oceanic-plates ($\geq$ 85 $Ma$), yet is still distinct. Thin black lines are average \gls{pt} gradients of 5 $K/km$ and 20 $K/km$ (calculated with a lithostatic gradient of 35 $km/GPa$).

#### Upper-plate Thickness Effect

Chapter \@ref(chpt2) demonstrates an association between upper-plate thickness and coupling depth in the same numerical experiments that markers are sampled from [@kerswell2020 ]. \gls{pt} distributions of markers are therefore expected to respond strongly to changes in upper-plate thickness, especially with respect to pressure (depth). However, a surprisingly modest effect is observed (Figure \@ref(fig:zupDensity)). Marker density transitions towards more uniform distributions and higher top-end pressures with increasing upper-plate thickness, while average \gls{pt} gradients significantly decrease. The shift towards more abundant (ultra-)\gls{hp} rocks with increasing upper-plate thickness is more modest than anticipated from Chapter \@ref(chpt2) but still consistent with a general increase in mechanical coupling depth with increasing upper-plate thickness [@kerswell2020; @ruh2015].

Notably, markers recovered from simulations with thin upper-plates ($\leq$ 62 $km$) match `pd15` well in terms of *absolute* \gls{pt} distribution. Yet, marker densities draw the opposite association (thicker upper-plates are most consistent with `pd15`). A noticeable absence of markers recovered from pressures of approximately 2 $GPa$ in simulations with thin upper-plates is also inconsistent with `pd15`, which has a modest-probability hill around 2 $GPa$ where relatively few markers get recovered.

(ref:zupDensityCap) \gls{pt} distribution of recovered markers by upper-plate lithospheric thickness (panel headers = $km$). Marker \gls{pt} distributions (colored contours) become marginally more uniform and have lower average \gls{pt} gradients with increasing upper-plate thickness. The rock record (`pd15`; light grey contours) is most consistent with thin upper-plates ($\leq$ 62 $km$) in terms of absolute \gls{pt} distribution. Regardless of upper-plate thickness, relatively few markers are recovered from pressures around 2 $GPa$ compared to the rock record. In general, upper-plate thickness has a surprisingly small effect on the \gls{pt} distribution of recovered markers with respect to pressure. Thin black lines are average \gls{pt} gradients of 5 $K/km$ and 20 $K/km$ (calculated with a lithostatic gradient of 35 $km/GPa$).

#### Detachment Timing Effect

Figure \@ref(fig:detachDensity) shows marker \gls{pt} distributions at 10 percent increments of total subduction duration. Marker recovery exhibits three trends with respect to time. First, marker recovery rates decrease through time with a substantial drop after approximately 40% of total subduction duration. Second, average \gls{pt} gradients rotate anti-clockwise from approximately 10-15 to 5 $K/km$ after 50% of total subduction duration. Finally, markers are recovered from increasingly higher pressures beginning from 0.2-1.3 to 3.5 $GPa$ by 40% of total subduction duration. Secular trends in marker recovery show significant low-P, moderate- to high-T marker recovery (greenschist to amphibolite facies) during the first 30-40% of the subduction life-cycle, followed by a higher relative proportion of (ultra-)\gls{hp} markers (blueschist and eclogites). Absolute \gls{pt} trends are most consistent with `pd15` during the first third of the subduction life-cycle, but marker probability density is most consistent with `pd15` during the final half of the subduction life-cycle.

(ref:detachDensityCap) \gls{pt} distribution of recovered markers by relative detachment timing (panel headers = 10% increments of total subduction duration). Marker \gls{pt} distributions (colored contours) are restricted to lower-P, moderate- to higher-T conditions through the first third of the subduction life-cycle. Average \gls{pt} gradients then progressively rotate towards cooler conditions while recovery extends to higher pressures through time ($\geq$ 0.3). Recovery rates continuously fall (contours get smoother) through time with a significant decrease after approximately 40% of the subduction life-cycle has passed. Absolute \gls{pt} and probability distributions are both time-dependent. Grey contours represent the \gls{pt} distribution of the rock record (`pd15`). Thin black lines are average \gls{pt} gradients of 5 $K/km$ and 20 $K/km$ (calculated with a lithostatic gradient of 35 $km/GPa$).

### Recovery Rates

A notable pattern emerges when comparing recovery rates among all 64 subduction simulations by thermo-kinematic boundary conditions (Figure \@ref(fig:recRate)). Simulations with younger and more slowly converging oceanic-plates (low-$\Phi$) have higher recovery rates than older and more quickly converging oceanic-plates (high-$\Phi$). This negative correlation between $\Phi$ and recovery rate appears gradual and continuous. In contrast, no apparent correlation exists between recovery rate and upper-plate lithospheric thickness. Please also note that low-$\Phi$ simulations generally appear to have broader distributions of marker recovery across pressure in addition to higher recovery rates (Figure \@ref(fig:recRate)).

On average `r round(mean(class.summary$est.ratio)*100, 1)` percent of markers get recovered from subduction (Table \@ref(tab:recSummary)). While volumes of rock cannot be directly computed from recovery rates because markers are mathematical point features, volumes may be roughly estimated by assuming markers represent the entire 760 $\times$ 8 $km$ section of oceanic crust and seafloor sediments they were sampled from. Rates of subducted material then range from `r format(round(min((1-class.summary$est.ratio)*760*8)), big.mark = ',')` to `r format(round(max((1-class.summary$est.ratio)*760*8)), big.mark = ',')` $km^3/km$, with a mean of `r format(round(mean((1-class.summary$est.ratio)*760*8)), big.mark = ',')` $km^3/km$. Rates of recovered material range from `r format(round(min(class.summary$est.ratio*760*8)), big.mark = ',')` to `r format(round(max(class.summary$est.ratio*760*8)), big.mark = ',')` $km^3/km$, with a mean of `r format(round(mean(class.summary$est.ratio*760*8)), big.mark = ',')` $km^3/km$.


(ref:recRateCap) Recovery rates for all 64 subduction simulations by thermo-kinematic boundary conditions. Negative correlations are observed among recovery rate, oceanic-plate age ($Ma$), convergence velocity ($km/Ma$), and thermal parameter ($\Phi$; $km/100$). Note that $\Phi$ is simply the product of oceanic-plate age and convergence velocity. No apparent correlation is observed between recovery rate and upper-plate thickness ($km$). Data point size and color represent the interquartile range of maximum marker pressures ($GPa$). The youngest and slowest-moving oceanic-plates generally have the highest recovery rates and marker recovery across broader ranges of pressures.

## Discussion {#chpt4Discussion}

### Recovery Rates

Marker recovery rates show a smooth negative correlation with $\Phi$ and no correlation with upper-plate thickness (Figure \@ref(fig:recRate)). Geodynamic factors contributing to this association are difficult to deduce, however, partly because $\Phi$ itself was formulated from a general relationship among thermo-kinematic boundary conditions to explain differences in earthquake distributions among subduction zones [@molnar1979; @kirby1991; @gorbatov1997; @mckenzie1969], and likely never intended as a precise tool for investigating subduction zone geodynamics. Notwithstanding, oceanic-plate age appears to explain most of the correlation between recovery rates and $\Phi$. Average recovery rate drops systematically with increasing oceanic-plate age. In contrast, only the slowest-converging simulations (40 $km/Ma$) appear to have distinct recovery rates compared to more quickly-converging simulations ($\geq$ 66 $km/Ma$; Figure \@ref(fig:recRate)). 

A common observation among simulations with young oceanic-plates, especially at slow convergence rates, are high subduction angles. Moreover, simulations with high subduction angles tend to create more space for underplating detached material (see Figure \@ref(fig:geodyn), discussed below). These observations imply recovery rates respond to $\Phi$ because of differences in plate flexibility and overall subduction geometry, rather than oceanic-plate age and convergence velocity *per se*. Please note, however, that subduction angle appears to be most strongly correlated with subduction duration compared to other thermo-kinematic boundary conditions [@hu2020]. Drawing a relationship among $\Phi$, subduction angle, and recovery rates, without also considering subduction duration, is therefore inconclusive. Recovery rates may obviously correlate with $\Phi$, but a concrete explanation is difficult to untangle.

### PT Distributions

Although \gls{pt} distributions of recovered markers for some simulations are consistent with `pd15` in absolute terms, probability densities bear little resemblance to `pd15` for most simulations. From an absolute perspective, marker \gls{pt} distributions from simulations with moderate to fast convergence velocities ($\geq$ 66 $km/Ma$; Figure \@ref(fig:cvDensity)), older oceanic-plates ($\geq$ 85 $Ma$; Figure \@ref(fig:ageDensity)), or thin upper-plates ($\leq$ 62 $km$; Figure \@ref(fig:zupDensity)) could be considered consistent with `pd15`. However, it would be very unlikely to reproduce `pd15` by randomly sampling markers from the above simulations. Only the slowest-converging simulations recover \gls{hp} rocks with similar relative frequency across pressures of $\sim$ 0.8 to 2.4 $GPa$ compared to `pd15` (Figure \@ref(fig:ecdfs)).

(ref:ecdfsCap) Coupling depths of recovered marker pressures by thermo-kinematic boundary conditions. Convergence velocity has the largest effect on the pressure distributions of recovered markers (topleft). Only the slowest-converging simulations (40 $km/Ma$) resemble the rock record (`pd15`; thin jagged black line) and are distinct from faster-converging simulations ($\geq$ 66 $km/Ma$), implying a geodynamic shift towards more discrete recovery along the plate interface at > 40 $km/Ma$. Oceanic-plate ages have a moderate effect on marker recovery, with older plates recovering more markers from 1.5 to 2.5 $GPa$ (topright). The thermal parameter shows a range of marker distributions that reflect the combined effects of convergence velocity and age (bottomleft). Upper-plate thickness has surprisingly little effect on marker recovery (bottomright). Regardless of thermo-kinematic boundary conditions, most simulations present distributions that do overlap with `pd15`. \gls{hp} rocks between 0.8 and 2.4 $GPa$ are overrepresented in `pd15` compared to most simulations.

```{r ecdfs, fig.cap='(ref:ecdfsCap)', fig.scap='Cumulative probability distributions of marker `maxP` by thermo-kinematic initial conditions'}

include_graphics('assets/figs/chpt4/ecdfs.png')

```

The fact that very few simulations recover as many markers from 0.8 to 2.4 $GPa$ compared to `pd15`, except for the slowest-converging systems (Figure \@ref(fig:ecdfs)), is a key result of this study. Different possible interpretations may follow from this observation. For example, the rock record may be comprised of \gls{hp} rocks mostly recovered from slowly-converging subduction zones. Alternatively, the rock record may not reflect the true distribution of \gls{hp} rocks recovered in subduction zones and is overrepresented (biased) by \gls{hp} rocks between 0.8 to 2.4 $GPa$. A simple calculation may test the former interpretation:

> One-half of modern day subduction zone segments have estimated convergence velocities below 66 $km/Ma$ [@syracuse2010]. As a conservative estimate, the prior probability of sampling a \gls{hp} rock from a slowly-converging system is around 50%, assuming the proportion of slowly-converging systems is constant through time and recovery rates are equal among subduction zones. So the chance of sampling a \gls{hp} rock from a slowly-converging system is not exceedingly small. However, the probability that half (n = `r format(nrow(pd15[pd15$pressure >= 0.8 & pd15$pressure <= 2.4,])/2, big.mark = ',')`) of \gls{hp} rocks in `pd15` with pressure estimates between 0.8 and 2.4 $GPa$ (n = `r format(nrow(pd15[pd15$pressure >= 0.8 & pd15$pressure <= 2.4,]), big.mark = ',')`) were sampled from slowly-converging systems can be approximated by a binomial probability distribution:
>
> \begin{equation}P(k) = B\left(n \atop k \right)\ p^k\ q^{n-k} = B\left(260 \atop 130 \right)\ 0.5^{130}\ 0.5^{130} \approx 5\% (\#eq:binom) \end{equation}
>
> where $P(k)$ is the probability of sampling $k=130$ \gls{hp} rocks from $n=260$ trials, $B\left( n \atop k \right) = n!/k!(n-k)!$ is the binomial distribution, and $p$ and $q$ are the chances of sampling a \gls{hp} frock from a slowly-converging system and not sampling a \gls{hp} rock, respectively.

In other words, there is a 5% chance that 130/260 \gls{hp} rocks in `pd15` were sampled exclusively from slowly-converging ($\leq$ 66 $km/Ma$) subduction zones. It is therefore unlikely that `pd15` represents preferential sampling of \gls{hp} rocks from only slowly-converging subduction zones (the same principle can also be applied to other thermo-kinematic boundary conditions). Rather, it is much more likely that `pd15` reflects an overabundance of undifferentiated samples between 0.8 and 2.4 $GPa$. While the true distribution of \gls{hp} rock recovered globally cannot be known, rough calculations demonstrating the improbability of preferential sampling from a subset of subduction zones and a general inconsistency among marker \gls{pt} distributions and the rock record stress the importance of differentiating \gls{pt} estimates with relevant metadata. For example, sorting aggregated suites of \gls{hp} rocks by like metamorphic ages, lithologies, and estimates for thermo-kinematic boundary conditions [e.g. @agard2018], make for better comparisons with natural and simulated \gls{ptt} datasets.

### Geodynamic regimes {#geodynamics}

Marker motions are constrained by a high-viscosity wedge of upper mantle in the forearc region (known as the *cold nose*) and a low-viscosity serpentinized subduction channel (see Appendix \@ref(vis)). Four geodynamic regimes are observed across all 64 simulations, each with a different channel geometry and pressure distribution of recovered markers (Figure \@ref(fig:geodyn)). Thick, rigid oceanic-plates, especially converging at high velocities (high-$\Phi$), tend to have low subduction angles and narrow subduction channels. Most markers are recovered at the base of the accretionary prism and no eclogites are recovered. These simulations imply systems with low subduction angles are expected to have low recovery rates from pressures $\geq$ 1.5 $GPa$ (Figure \@ref(fig:geodyn), cdh94).

(ref:geodynCap) Geodynamic regimes generally observed in subduction simulations (main panels) and their marker \glspl{cdf} with respect to pressure (insets). Simulations with thick-rigid oceanic-plates (cdh94) tend to have low subduction angles, especially at high convergence rates (high-$\Phi$), and no eclogite recovery. The other three regimes all share flexible plates, higher subduction angles, and recovery of eclogites to different extents. Slowly-converging simulations (cde62) tend to have wide low-viscosity serpentinized channels that store underplated material uniformly with depth. Simulations like cde62 are consistent with `pd15` in terms of their \glspl{cdf} (inset). The final two regimes (cdb78 & cda78) show deep opening of the serpentine channel. The mantle wedge completely detaches from the upper-plate in several models and diapirs rise in subvertical low-viscosity channels behind the mantle wedge. Simulations with diapirs also closely resemble `pd15` in terms their \glspl{cdf}.

```{r geodyn, out.width='85%', fig.cap='(ref:geodynCap)', fig.scap='Geodynamic regimes their probability distributions of recovered markers'}

include_graphics('assets/figs/chpt4/geodynamics.png')

```

The other three geodynamic regimes share two commonalities: 1) they recover eclogites to various degrees, and 2) they have more flexible oceanic-plates and higher subduction angles. Slowly-converging systems with flexible plates (low-$\Phi$) tend to have wider subduction channels that accommodate more underplating of oceanic crust and sediments along the length of the subduction interface compared to flatter subduction angles (Figure \@ref(fig:geodyn), cde62). Markers from simulations with higher subduction angles display more uniform \glspl{cdf}, with respect to pressure, that closely resemble `pd15` (compare insets in Figure \@ref(fig:geodyn)). These observations again imply rock recovery is sensitive to the geometry of subduction, which may be conflated with other thermo-kinematic boundary conditions when using $\Phi$ as an explanatory variable.

The last two geodynamic regimes are characterized by narrow channels that widen at depth, separating the cold nose from the upper-plate (Figure \@ref(fig:geodyn) cdb78, cda78). In many simulations, the mantle wedge separates entirely and the low-viscosity serpentine channel connects with the lower continental crust. A subvertical, low-viscosity corridor forms and markers rise as diapirs into the mantle wedge (Figure \@ref(fig:geodyn), cda78). Moreover, markers \glspl{cdf} from simulations with diapirs closely resemble `pd15` (compare insets in Figure \@ref(fig:geodyn)). These simulations imply mantle wedge separation may be a plausible mechanism for diapir formation.

## Conclusion {#chpt4Conclusions}

This study traces \gls{ptt} paths of more than one-million markers from 64 subduction simulations, identifies recovered markers, and computes their \gls{pt} distributions across a range of thermo-kinematic boundary conditions. \gls{ptt} distributions of recovered markers are compared with the rock record (`pd15`) to address the following hypotheses:

> 1. The probability of recovering \gls{hp} rocks is relatively uniform up to `r round(tail(pd15$pressure[pd15$cumulative <= 0.8], 1), 1)` $GPa$ (null: recovery is non-uniform with depth)
>
> 2. Recovery rates of \gls{hp} rocks vary with thermo-kinematic boundary conditions (null: recovery rates are not different among subduction zone)

With respect to the first hypothesis, \gls{pt} distributions of recovered markers are distinct from the rock record (`pd15`) across almost all simulations except for a minority of slowly-converging models (40 $km/Ma$, Figure \@ref(fig:ecdfs)), and models that develop separated mantle wedges and diapirs (Figure \@ref(fig:geodyn)). The majority of simulations recovery relatively few markers from 0.8 to 2.4 $GPa$ compared to `pd15`. This result implies `pd15` is overrepresented (biased) by \gls{hp} rocks between 0.8 and 2.4 $GPa$. Differentiating the rock record by relevant metadata (lithology, metamorphic ages, thermo-kinematic boundary conditions estimates) is critically important to select against such bias [e.g. @agard2018].

With respect to the second hypothesis, recovered markers show a negative correlation between $\Phi$ and recovery rate, implying a strong dependence of recovery rates on thermo-kinematic boundary conditions. However, simulations also show an apparent association between recovery rates and subduction angle. This may imply that recovery rates are sensitive to $\Phi$ because of differences in subduction geometry, rather than oceanic-plate age or convergence velocity *per se*. Correlations among recovery rate and thermo-kinematic boundary conditions are difficult to untangle because $\Phi$ conflates thermo-kinematic effects (by design) and is therefore not the most precise explanatory variable. While a correlation between recovery rates and $\Phi$ is apparent, the sensitivity of recovery rates to thermo-kinematic boundary conditions (Figure \@ref(fig:recRate)), especially subduction geometry, warrants further investigation.

# Conclusion {#chpt5}

\markboth{Chapter 5: Conclusion}{Chapter 5: Conclusion}

This work uses three computational approaches---simulation, interpolation, and applied statistics---to address the following question. How diverse is mechanical behavior along the plate interface across a range of plausible subduction zone configurations?

Plate coupling observed in numerical simulations from Chapter \@ref(chpt2) demonstrate steady-state mechanical behavior regulated self-consistently by feedbacks involving heat transfer and metamorphic dehydration of ultramafic sheet silicates in the upper-plate mantle. Coupling depth is only weakly correlated with $\Phi$ but strongly correlated with upper-plate lithospheric thickness. Thus uniform coupling depths are expected if subduction zones have uniformly thick upper-plates, which is indeed the case when considering averaged backarc surface heat flow for 17 presently active subduction zones [@currie2004; @hyndman2005; @currie2006; @wada2009].

However, 2D interpolations in Chapter \@ref(chpt3) show diverse spatial patterns of surface heat flow---some implying homogeneous thermal structure, others implying heterogeneous thermal structure---near 13 presently active subduction zones. While Kriging methods yield inconsistent results for segments with low observation densities, Similarity methods show geologically-consistent interpolations of surface heat flow across all segments. Both methods, where applicable, generally agree and present surface heat flow interpolations in contradiction of broadly uniform upper-plate lithospheric thickness inferred from other (1D) sampling strategies [e.g. @currie2004; @hyndman2005; @currie2006; @wada2009]. These results imply broadly non-uniform coupling depths among subduction zones.

Chapter \@ref(chpt4) takes a different approach by considering what \gls{pt} distributions of \gls{hp} rocks imply about mechanical variability among subduction zones. A large (`r format(nrow(fts.summary[fts.summary$rec,]), big.mark = ',')`) dataset of recovered markers shows marker \gls{ptt} distributions and recovery rates correlate with $\Phi$ and subduction duration, but not upper-plate lithospheric thickness (as expected from Chapter \@ref(chpt2)). These results imply broad differences in the mechanics of rock recovery through time and among subduction zones.

While self-regulating mechanisms of uniform (and sustained) depths of plate coupling among different subduction zones are plausible (Chapter \@ref(chpt2)), 2D interpolations of surface heat flow (Chapter \@ref(chpt3)), and \gls{ptt} distributions of recovered markers (Chapter \@ref(chpt4)) imply a more diverse picture of mechanical behavior across different subduction zone settings. One reason for such assorted conclusions is using a relatively crude explanatory variable ($\Phi$) for comparison. $\Phi$ is demonstrably useful for explaining variability among some features of subduction zone geodynamics [@molnar1979; @kirby1991; @gorbatov1997; @wada2009; @syracuse2010], but demonstrably ineffective in many cases [@maunder2019]. Future work may focus on developing new explanatory variables, scaling surface heat flow datasets, and developing composite interpolation approaches to better estimate relative geodynamic variability among subduction zones.

## Serpentine Stability Depth Through Time {#antDepth}

Stability of serpentine progressively increases with depth along the plate interface as the subducting oceanic-plate continuously cools and hydrates the shallow upper-plate mantle. However, this phenomenon ceases after approximately 5 $Ma$ and dynamics change. From approximately 5 $Ma$ to tens of $Ma$ afterwards, the lower limit of serpentine dehydration stabilizes (Figure \@ref(fig:antDepth)). In theory, serpentine dehydration should continue to increase as long as water continues to flux from the oceanic-plate and the shallow upper-plate remains stagnant and cooling. Stability of serpentine dehydration through tens of $Ma$ is direct result of the correspondence between mechanical coupling and absence of serpentine along the plate interface. Notably, using Lagrangian frameworks to implement metamorphic reactions is an advantageous numerical feature allowing for such behavior.

```{r antDepth, fig.cap='Serpentine stability depth at the plate interface vs. time for models cda, cdf, and cdp with $Z_{UP}$ = 46, 62, 78, and 94 $km$. Serpentine stabilization deepens for approximately 5 $Ma$ of subduction and then remains roughly constant for $\\leq$ 10 $Ma$. The exceptions are models with very thin $Z_{UP}$, which exhibit transient behavior for at least 15 $Ma$. Overall serpentine stability depth after approximately 5 $Ma$ depends on upper-plate thickness.', fig.scap='Serpentine stability depth vs. time'}

Numerical experiments in this chapter suggest a negative dynamic feedback regulating coupling and serpentine dehydration can help explain how similar configurations, in terms of depths to subducting plates beneath arcs [@england2004] and thin upper-plates [@currie2006], may occur in subduction zones with different thermo-kinematic boundary conditions and subduction durations. The results indicate that subduction zones quickly ($<$ 5 $Ma$) develop and stabilize quasi-permanent, generalized configurations with coupling depth dependent on upper-plate thickness.

Notable exceptions occur in models with the thinnest upper-plates ($Z_{UP}$ = 46 $km$). Rapid extension due to thin upper-plates form spreading centers in the upper-plate within 5 $Ma$. Passive asthenospheric upwelling near spreading centers diverts heat from deep within the upper-plate mantle. Enough heat is apparently diverted to disrupt thermal feedbacks regulating coupling and serpentine stability near the plate interface. In principle, diversion of heat from the plate interface could lead to cooler conditions, deeper serpentine stability, and thus deeper coupling. Further testing to confirm this behavior may artificially increase upper-plate strength in thin upper-plate thickness experiments to prevent high rates of spreading.

## Regression Summaries {#regSummary}

The form of the preferred quadratic regression model in Section \@ref(cdEstimators) (Figure \@ref(fig:results) & Table \@ref(tab:zcResults)) implies a lower limit to coupling depth of approximately 60 $km$, even for thin upper-plate thickness and, presumably, under warm conditions during nascent subduction. In principle, thin upper-plates could allow effective heat transfer in a flowing shallow asthenospheric mantle---hindering deep stabilization of serpentine. Olivine and pyroxene would be the stable mantle minerals, and strong, shallow coupling between plates would be expected @gerya2008. However, even the warmest numerical experiments (low-$\Phi$ & thin upper-plate thickness) in Chapter \@ref(chpt2) eventually stabilize serpentine in the shallow upper-plate mantle. This is evident by increasing depth of mechanical coupling with time for the first 5 $Ma$ of subduction (Figure \@ref(fig:antDepth)).

## (De)hydration Model {#deHydration}

The material properties used in the numerical experiments are listed in Table \@ref(tab:materials) and Table \@ref(tab:melts). For details about the sedimentation and erosion, melting and extraction, and rheological models, please refer to @sizova2010. Here we discuss only the hydrodynamic model, because it is the most relevant aspect of the numerical experiments.

Hydrodynamics in the numerical models control the timing and magnitude of mantle wedge hydration. The main sources of water delivered to the mantle are altered basaltic crust and seafloor sediments, which we assumed to contain up to 5 $wt.\% H_{2}O$. We assumed a gradual expulsion of water from pore space and through quasi-continuous dehydration reactions occurring within the slab. Water content is computed using the following equation:

\begin{equation}
  \chi_{H_{2}O} = \chi_{H_{2}O_{init}}\times\left(1-\frac{\Delta z}{150\times 10^{3}}\right)
\end{equation}

where $\chi_{H_{2}O_{init}}$ = 5 $wt.\%$ and $\Delta z$ is a marker's depth below the topographical surface.

If a rock marker dehydrates, an independent water particle is instantaneously generated at the same location with the respective $H_{2}O$ content. The new water particle is moved in accordance to the local velocity field, described by the following equation:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \vec{v}_{\text{water}} & = (\vec{v}_x,\ \vec{v}_z) \\
    \vec{v}_z & = \vec{v}_z - \vec{v}_{z(\text{percolation})} \\
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where $\vec{v}_{water}$ is the velocity vector of the water particle, $\vec{v}_{x}$ and $\vec{v}_{z}$ are the local velocity vectors of the solid state mantle or crust, and $\vec{v}_{z(percolation)}$ is a imposed constant upward percolation velocity (10 $cm/year$). We implicitly neglect kinetics of reactions, as material properties of markers change instantaneously at equilibrium reactions.

## Rheologic Sensitivity Tests on Plate Coupling {#rheologicSensitivity}

Numerical modelling practitioners simulating subduction zones approach mechanical coupling between plates differently. A simple, but highly effective approach, is prescribing a layer of arbitrary strength extending from the surface to an arbitrary depth or temperature along the plate interface. This approach effectively inhibits transfer of shear stress between plates and is analogous to controlling a no-slip condition at the interface (plates move with the same velocity vector beyond the coupling point). Numerous models use this method [e.g. @peacock1996; @peacock1999b; @wada2009; @syracuse2010] in part because it allows fine-tuning to specific subduction zone configurations. Serpentine-or talc-rich horizons are typically invoked to justify implementing such a condition at shallow interface depths.

The experiments outlined in Section \@ref(numMethods) do not explicitly define coupling, but rather use a rheologic model that explicitly follows experimentally determined flow laws and mineral stability fields. This approach conceptually follows and extends petrologic explanations for a weak interface [@hyndman2003; @peacock1999a]. As a corollary, dehydration of serpentine, or possibly talc, at higher temperatures must strengthen the interface [@agard2016]. Noting that talc is unstable at P $>$ 2.0 $GPa$ in an ultramafic rock [@schmidt1998], a serpentine rheology is arguably the most relevant candidate responsible for a strength increase, and thus coupling, at \gls{pt} conditions inferred for coupling in active subduction zones [@wada2009; @syracuse2010].

Sensitivity tests of the rheologic model presented in Section \@ref(rheologicModel) were run using diverse experiments adjusting the rheology of serpentine (compared to Table \@ref(tab:materials)), the shape and position of the antigorite-out reaction (compared to \@ref(eq:antstab)), and certain hydrodynamic parameters. For brevity, these results are not presented here. The experiments included:

1. antigorite $\leftarrow$ wet olivine flow law
2. antigorite and wet olivine $\leftarrow$ dry olivine flow law
3. isothermal antigorite reaction at 690 $^{\circ}C$
4. antigorite reaction isothermal Clapeyron slope at 715 $^{\circ}C$
5. antigorite reaction with positive linear Clapeyron slope
6. linear release of $H_{2}O$ with depth
7. no fluid-induced weakening

Only experiments 5 and 7 listed above were inconsistent with the results presented Section \@ref(chpt2Results). Experiment 5 results in transient coupling depths and discontinuous antigorite stability in the upper-plate mantle, whereas experiment 7 results in two-sided subduction [e.g. @gerya2008]. These sensitivity experiments imply numerical coupling mechanisms are mostly contingent on fluid flux to the upper-plate mantle and the implementation of serpentine stability. The experiments also show coupling is relatively insensitive to the exact flow law parameters.

## Surface Heat Flow

Below is surface heat flow calculated at 2 $km$ beneath the topographic surface at approximately 10 $Ma$ for all numerical experiments presented in Chapter \@ref(chpt2).

## Kriging System and Optimization {#krigeOpt}

### Ordinary Kriging

This study applies isotropic ordinary Kriging methods under the following general assumptions:

- $\hat{\gamma}(h)$ is directionally invariant (isotropic)
- $\hat{\gamma}(h)$ is evaluated in two-dimensions and neglects elevation
- The first and second moments of $Z(u)$ are assumed to follow the conditions:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    &E[Z(u)] = \hat{Z}(u) = constant \\
    &E[(Z(u + h) - \hat{Z}(u))(Z(u) - \hat{Z}(u))] = C(h)
  \end{aligned}
  (\#eq:krigeAssumptions)
\end{equation}

where $h$ is the lag distance, $C(h)$ is the covariance function, $E[Z(u)]$ is the expected value of the random variable $Z(u)$, and $\hat{Z}(u)$ is the arithmetic mean of $Z(u)$.

Equation \@ref(eq:krigeAssumptions) is known as "weak second-order stationarity". It assumes the underlying probability distribution of the observations $Z(u)$ does not change in space and the covariance $C(h)$ only depends on the distance $h$ between two observations. These assumptions are expected to be valid in cases where the underlying natural process is stochastic, spatially continuous, and has the property of additivity such that $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n Z(u_i)$ has the same meaning as $Z(u)$ [@bardossy1997].

The following are two illustrative cases where Equation \@ref(eq:krigeAssumptions) is likely valid:

> The thickness of a sedimentary unit with a homogeneous concentration of radioactive elements can be approximated by $q_s = q_b + \int A \,dz$, where $q_b$ is a constant heat flux entering the bottom of the layer and $A$ is the heat production within the layer with thickness $z$ [@furlong2013]. If one has two samples, $Z(u_1) = 31~mW/m^2$ and $Z(u_2) = 30.5~mW/m^2$, their corresponding thicknesses would be $Z'(u_1) = 1000~m$ and $Z'(u_2) = 500~m$ for $A = 0.001~mW/m^3$ and $q_b = 30~mW/m^2$. The variable, $Z(u)$, in this case is additive because the arithmetic mean of the samples is a good approximation of the average sedimentary layer thickness, $(Z(u_1) + Z(u_2)) / 2 = 750~m$.

> The age of young oceanic lithosphere can be approximated by $q_s(t) = kT_b(\pi\kappa t)^{-1/2}$, where $q_s(t)$ is surface heat flow of a plate with age, $t$, $T_b$ is the temperature at the base of the plate, $k$ is thermal conductivity, and $\kappa = k/\rho C_p$ is thermal diffusivity [@stein1992]. Using reasonable values for $k = 3.138~W/mK$, $\rho = 3330~kg/m^3$, $C_p = 1171~J/kgK$, $T_b = 1350^{\circ}C$, two samples, $Z(u_1) = 180~mW/m^2$ and $Z(u_2) = 190~mW/m^2$, would correspond to plates with ages of $Z'(u_1) = 10~Ma$, and $Z'(u_2) = 9~Ma$, respectively. Since $Z(u_1) + Z(u_2) / 2 = 185~mW/m^2$ and $Z'(185~mW/m^2) = 9.5~Ma = Z'(u_1) + Z'(u_2) / 2$, the variable $Z(u)$ in this case is also additive.

Equation \@ref(eq:krigeAssumptions) is likely invalid in regions that transition among two or more tectonic regimes, however. For example, the expected (mean) heat flow $E[Z(u)]$ will change when moving from a spreading center to a subduction zone and thus $E[Z(u)] \neq constant$ over the region of interest. In other words, stationarity is violated and Kriging estimates will become spurious.

The second step is fitting a variogram model $\gamma(h)$ to the experimental variogram. This study fits six popular variogram models with sills (or theoretical sills) to the experimental variogram. The models are defined as [@pebesma2004]:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    Bes &\leftarrow \gamma(h) = 1 - \frac{h}{a}\ K_1\left(\frac{h}{a}\right) \quad \text{for } \  h \geq 0 \\
    Cir &\leftarrow \gamma(h) =
    \begin{cases}
      \frac{2}{\pi}\frac{h}{a}\ \sqrt{1-\left(\frac{h}{a}\right)^2} + \frac{2}{\pi}\ arcsin\left(\frac{h}{a}\right) \quad \text{for } \  0 \leq h \leq a \\
      n + s \quad \text{for } \  h > a
    \end{cases} \\
    Exp &\leftarrow \gamma(h) = 1 - exp\left(\frac{-h}{a}\right) \quad \text{for } \  h \geq 0 \\
    Gau &\leftarrow \gamma(h) = 1 - exp\left(\left[\frac{-h}{a}\right]^2\right) \quad \text{for } \  h \geq 0 \\
    Lin &\leftarrow \gamma(h) =
    \begin{cases}
      \frac{h}{a} \quad \text{for } \  0 \leq h \leq a \\
      n + s \quad \text{for } \  h > a
    \end{cases} \\
    Sph &\leftarrow \gamma(h) =
    \begin{cases}
      \frac{3}{2}\frac{h}{a} - \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{h}{a}\right)^3 \quad \text{for } \  0 \leq h \leq a \\
      n + s \quad \text{for } \  h > a
    \end{cases} \\
  \end{aligned}
  (\#eq:varMods)
\end{equation}

where $n$ is the nugget, $s$ is the sill, $a$ is the effective range, $K_1$ is a modified Bessel function. The models are Bessel, Circular, Exponential, Gaussian, Linear, and Spherical. For models without explicit sills (Bes, Exp, Gau), the effective range $a$ is the distance where the variogram reaches 95% of its maximum defined as 4$a$, 3$a$, and $\sqrt{3}a$ for Bes, Exp, and Gau, respectively [@graler2016; @pebesma2004]. The function `fit.variogram` in `gstat` is used to try all variogram models. The best model is selected by the minimum weighted least squares [@pebesma2004] error with weights proportional to the number of points in each lag divided by the squared lag distance $wt = N(h)_k/h_k^2)$.

Ordinary Kriging is used for interpolation, which estimates unknown observations $\hat{Z}(u)$ as a linear combination of all known observations [@bardossy1997]:

\begin{equation}
  \hat{Z}(u) = \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i Z(u_i)
  (\#eq:linEstimate)
\end{equation}

The conditions in Equation \@ref(eq:krigeAssumptions) set up a constrained minimization problem that can be solved with a system of linear equations. The expected value of $Z(u)$ is assumed to be the mean according to \@ref(eq:krigeAssumptions), so the weights must be:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    E[\hat{Z}(u)] &= \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i E[Z(u_i)] \\
    \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i &= 1
  \end{aligned}
  (\#eq:unbiased)
\end{equation}

This constraint is known as the unbiased condition, which states that the sum of the weights must equal one. However, there is an infinite set of real numbers one could use for the weights, $\lambda_i$. The goal is to find the set of weights in Equation \@ref(eq:linEstimate) that minimizes the estimation variance. This can be solved by minimizing the covariance function, $C(h)$ from Equation \@ref(eq:krigeAssumptions):

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    & \sigma^2(u) = Var[Z(u) - \hat{Z}(u)] = \\
    & E\left[(Z(u) - \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i Z(u_i))^2\right] = \\
    & E\left[Z(u)^2 + \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_j \lambda_i Z(u_j)Z(u_i) - 2 \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i Z(u_i)Z(u)\right] = \\
    & C(0) + \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_j \lambda_i C(u_i - u_j) - 2 \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i C(u_i - u)
  \end{aligned}
  (\#eq:minVar)
\end{equation}

Minimizing Equation \@ref(eq:minVar) with respect to the unbiased condition (Equation \@ref(eq:unbiased)), yields the best linear unbiased estimator [BLUE, @bardossy1997] for Equation \@ref(eq:linEstimate) and together comprise the Kriging system of equations. The functions `krige` and `krige.cv` in `gstat` are used for surface heat flow interpolation and error estimation by k-fold cross-validation [@pebesma2004].

### Optimization with `nloptr` {#nloptr}

Achieving accurate Kriging results depends on one's choice of many Kriging parameters, $\Theta$. In this study, we investigate a set of parameters:

\begin{equation} 
  \Theta = \{model,\ n,\ c,\ n_{max},\ l\}
  (\#eq:params)
\end{equation}

where $model$ is one of the variogram models defined in Equation \@ref(eq:varMods), $n$ is the number of lags, $c$ is a lag cutoff proportionality constant, $n_{max}$ is the maximum point-pairs for local Kriging, and $l$ is a horizontal lag shift constant. The lag cutoff constant $c$ controls the maximum separation distance between pairs of points used to calculate the experimental variogram (i.e. the x-axis range or "width" of the experimental variogram). The horizontal lag shift constant $l$ removes the first few lags from being evaluated by effectively shifting all lags to the left proportionally by $l$. This is necessary to avoid negative ranges when fitting experimental variograms with anomalously high variances at small lag distances.

The goal is to find $\Theta$ such that the Kriging function $f(x_i;\ \Theta)$ gives the minimum error defined by a cost function $C(\Theta)$, which represents the overall goodness of fit of the interpolation. This study defines a cost function that simultaneously considers errors between the experimental variogram $\hat{\gamma}(h)$ and modelled variogram $\gamma(h)$, and between surface heat flow observations $Z(u_i)$ and Kriging estimates $\hat{Z}(u)$ [after @li2018]:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    C(\Theta) &= w_{vgrm}\ C_{vgrm}(\Theta) + w_{interp}\ C_{interp}(\Theta) \\
    &w_{vgrm} + w_{interp} = 1
  \end{aligned}
  (\#eq:cost)
\end{equation}

where $C_{vgrm}(\Theta)$ is the normalized \glsfirst{rmse} evaluated during variogram fitting and $C_{interp}(\Theta)$ is the normalized \gls{rmse} evaluated during Kriging. Weighted ordinary least squares is used to evaluate $C_{vgrm}(\Theta)$, whereas k-fold cross-validation is used to evaluate $C_{interp}(\Theta)$. K-fold splits the dataset $|Z(u_i)|$ into $k$ equal intervals, removes observations from an interval, and then estimates the removed observations by fitting a variogram model to data in the remaining $k-1$ intervals. This process is repeated over all $k$ intervals so that the whole dataset has been cross-validated. The final expression to minimize becomes:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    &C(\Theta) = \\
    &\frac{w_{vgrm}}{\sigma_{vgrm}}\ \left(\frac{1}{N(h)}\ \sum_{k=1}^{N}\ w(h_k)\ [\hat{\gamma}(h_k)-\gamma(h_k;\ \Theta)]^2\right)^{1/4} + \\
    &\frac{w_{interp}}{\sigma_{interp}}\ \left(\frac{1}{M}\ \sum_{i=1}^{M}\ [Z(u_i)-\hat{Z}(u_i;\ \Theta)]^2\right)^{1/2}
  \end{aligned}
  (\#eq:costExp)
\end{equation}

where $N(h)$ is the number of point-pairs used to evaluate the experimental variogram and $w(h_k) = N(h)_k/h_k^2$ are weights defining the importance of the $kth$ lag on the variogram model fit.  $Z(u_i)$ and $\hat{Z}(u_i;\ \Theta)$ are the observed and estimated values, respectively, and $M$ is the number of measurements in $|Z(u_i)|$. The \glspl{rmse} are normalized by dividing by $\sigma_{vgrm}$ and $\sigma_{interp}$, which represent the standard deviation of the experimental variogram $\hat{\gamma}(h)$ and surface heat flow observations $Z(u_i)$, respectively. The weights $w_{vgrm}$ and $w_{interp}$ were varied between 0 and 1 to test the effects on $C(\Theta)$. Preferred weights of $w_{vgrm}$ = $w_{interp}$ = 0.5 are selected to balance the effects of $C_{vgrm}(\Theta)$ and $C_{interp}(\Theta)$ on the cost function.

  tibble(
    cutoff.prop = c(1, 20),

Minimization of $C(\Theta)$ is achieved by non-linear constrained optimization using algorithms defined in the `R` package `nloptr` [@ypma2014] with bounds in Table \@ref(tab:nloptrBounds). Both global and local search methods were applied with similar success. Please see [the official documentation](https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/NLopt_Introduction/) for more information on `nloptr` and available optimization algorithms. The run used to produce the visualizations in Chapter \@ref(chpt3) uses the `NLOPT_LN_BOBYQA` option with 50 max iterations, cross-validation with k-folds equal to half of the number of observations in the evaluated segment, and cost function weights of $w_{vgrm}$ = $w_{interp}$ = 0.5 (Figure \@ref(fig:optTrace)).

(ref:sigmaDiffSummaryPlotCap) Summary of differences between Similarity and Kriging uncertainties. Note that differences are computed as [Similarity $-$ Krige]. Differences are centered at slightly negative values with median differences ranging from `r min(sigma.diff$median)` to `r max(sigma.diff$median)` $mWm^{-2}$, and broadly distributed with interquartile ranges from `r min(sigma.diff$IQR)` to `r max(sigma.diff$IQR)` $mWm^{-2}$ and long tails extending from `r min(sigma.diff$min)` to `r max(sigma.diff$max)` $mWm^{-2}$. Distributions are asymmetric and irregular, indicating regional differences in uncertainty across interpolation domains. Negative medians indicate greater uncertainties by Kriging compared to Similarity. Distributions are colored by quantiles (25%, 50%, 75%). Similarity data from @lucazeau2019. Please refer to Figure \@ref(fig:diffSummaryPlot) for estimate differences.

## Gaussian Mixture Models {#gmm}

Let the traced markers represent a $d$-dimensional array of $n$ random independent variables $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$. Assume markers $x_i$ were drawn from $k$ discrete probability distributions with parameters $\Phi$. The probability distribution of markers $x_i$ can be modeled with a mixture of $k$ components:

\begin{equation}
  p(x_i | \Phi) = \sum_{j=1}^k \pi_j p(x_i | \Theta_j)
  (\#eq:gmix)
\end{equation}

where $p(x_i | \Theta_j)$ is the probability of $x_i$ under the $j^{th}$ mixture component and $\pi_j$ is the mixture proportion representing the probability that $x_i$ belongs to the $j^{th}$ component $(\pi_j \geq 0; \sum_{j=1}^k \pi_j = 1)$.

Assuming $\Theta_j$ describes a Gaussian probability distributions with mean $\mu_j$ and covariance $\Sigma_j$, Equation \@ref(eq:gmix) becomes:

\begin{equation}
  p(x_i | \Phi) = \sum_{j=1}^k \pi_j \mathcal{N}(x_i | \mu_j, \Sigma_j)
  (\#eq:mix)
\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{N}(x_i | \mu_j, \Sigma_j) = \frac{exp\{ -\frac{1}{2}(x_i - \mu_j)(x_i - \mu_j)^T \Sigma_j^{-1}\}}{\sqrt{det(2 \pi \Sigma_j)}}
  (\#eq:gauss)
\end{equation}

The parameters $\mu_j$ and $\Sigma_j$, representing the center and shape of each cluster, are estimated by maximizing the log of the likelihood function, $L(x_i | \Phi) = \prod_{i=1}^n p(x_i | \Phi)$:

\begin{equation}
  log~L(x_i | \Phi) = log \prod_{i=1}^n p(x_i | \Phi) = \sum_{i=1}^n log \left[ \sum_{j=1}^k \pi_j p(x_i | \Theta_j) \right]
  (\#eq:loglik)
\end{equation}

Taking the derivative of Equation \@ref(eq:loglik) with respect to each parameter, $\pi$, $\mu$, $\Sigma$, setting the equation to zero, and solving for each parameter gives the maximum likelihood estimators:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    N_j &= \sum_{i=1}^n \omega_{i} \\
    \pi_j &= \frac{N_j}{n} \\
    \mu_j &= \frac{1}{N_j} \sum_{i=1}^n \omega_{i} x_i \\
    \Sigma_j &= \frac{1}{N_j} \sum_{i=1}^n \omega_{i} (x_i - \mu_j)(x_i - \mu_j)^T
  \end{aligned}
  (\#eq:mle)
\end{equation}

where $\omega_{i}$ ($\omega_{i} \geq 0; \sum_{j=1}^k \omega_{i} = 1$) are membership weights representing the probability of an observation $x_i$ belonging to the $j^{th}$ Gaussian and $N_j$ represents the number of observations belonging to the $j^{th}$ Gaussian. Please note that $\omega_{i}$ is unknown for markers so maximum likelihood estimator cannot be computed with Equation \@ref(eq:mle). The solution to this problem is the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, which is defined below.

General purpose functions in the `R` package `Mclust` [@scrucca2016] are used to fit Gaussian mixture models. "Fitting" refers to adjusting all $k$ Gaussian parameters $\mu_j$ and $\Sigma_j$ until the data and Gaussian ellipsoids achieve maximum likelihood defined by Equation \@ref(eq:loglik). After @banfield1993, covariance matrices $\Sigma$ in `Mclust` are parameterized to be flexible in their shape, volume, and orientation [@scrucca2016]:

\begin{equation}
  \Sigma_j = \lambda_j D_j A_j D_j^T
  (\#eq:eigen)
\end{equation}

where $D_j$ is the orthogonal eigenvector matrix, $A_j$ and $\lambda_j$ are diagonal matrices of values proportional to the eigenvalues. This implementation allows fixing one, two, or three geometric elements of the covariance matrices. That is, the volume $\lambda_j$, shape $A_j$, and orientation $D_j$ of Gaussian clusters can change or be fixed among all $k$ clusters [e.g. @celeux1995; @fraley2002]. Fourteen parameterizations of Equation \@ref(eq:eigen) are tried, representing different geometric combinations of the covariance matrices $\Sigma$ [see @scrucca2016] and the Bayesian information criterion is computed [@schwarz1978]. The parameterization for Equation \@ref(eq:eigen) is chosen by Bayesian information criterion.

## Expectation-Maximization

The Expectation-Maximization algorithm estimates Gaussian mixture model parameters by initializing $k$ Gaussians with parameters $(\pi_j, \mu_j, \Sigma_j)$, then iteratively computing membership weights with Equation \@ref(eq:posterior) and updating Gaussian parameters with Equation \@ref(eq:mle) until reaching a convergence threshold [@dempster1977].

The *expectation* (E-)step involves a "latent" multinomial variable $z_{i} \in \{1, 2, \dots, k\}$ representing the unknown classifications of $x_i$ with a joint distribution $p(x_i,z_{i}) = p(x_i | z_{i})p(z_{j})$. Membership weights $\omega_{i}$ are equivalent to the conditional probability $p(z_{i} | x_i)$, which represents the probability of observation $x_i$ belonging to the $j^{th}$ Gaussian. Given initial guesses for Gaussian parameters $\pi_j$, $\mu_j$, $\Sigma_j$, membership weights are computed using Bayes Theorem (E-step):

\begin{equation}
  p(z_{i} | x_i) = \frac{p(x_i | z_{i})p(z_{j})}{p(x_i)} = \frac{\pi_j \mathcal{N}(\mu_j, \Sigma_j)}{\sum_{j=1}^k \pi_j \mathcal{N}(\mu_j, \Sigma_j)} = \omega_{i}
  (\#eq:posterior)
\end{equation}

and Gaussian estimates are updated during the *maximization* (M-)step by applying $\omega_{i}$ to Equation \@ref(eq:mle). This step gives markers $x_i$ class labels $z_i \in \{1, \dots, k\}$ representing assignment to one of $k$ clusters (Figure \@ref(fig:class)).

## Thermal Parameter Effects

(ref:phiDensityCap) Marker PT distribution by thermal parameter $\Phi$. Changing patterns to the probability density of recovered markers (filled grey contours) with respect to thermal parameter appear non-systematic. A general change in morphology towards flatter, more segregated bimodal distributions is observed with increasing thermal parameter. The more continuous distributions for $\Phi$ of 13, 22, 34, and 44 stand out because these models correspond to the slowest-converging simulations (see Figure \@ref(fig:recRate)).

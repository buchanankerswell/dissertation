As noted by @gerya2014, a scarcity of observational constraints through time and space makes the study of geodynamics on Earth extraordinarily challenging (Figure \@ref(fig:sparse)). Luckily, application of various computational approaches---simulation, interpolation, and applied statistics---enable geodynamic inquiry despite sparse datasets. This dissertation leverages computational methods to investigate a fundamental component of Plate Tectonic theory, *subduction*.

Subduction occurs when two lithospheric plates converge and the denser plate *subducts* beneath the other at a *subduction zone*. Subduction zones are implicated in myriad geodynamic phenomena, including seismicity, metamorphism, volatile flux, volcanism, dynamic plate motions, and crustal deformation [@cizkova2013; @gonzalez2016; @hirauchi2010; @peacock1990; @peacock1991; @peacock1993; @peacock1996; @peacock1999a; @hacker2003; @vankeken2011; @grove2012; @gao2017]. These phenomena are largely defined by plate motions and mechanical behavior along the plate interface [@furukawa1993; @peacock1994; @peacock1996]. Important inputs and thermo-kinematic boundary conditions exerting first-order control on subduction zone structure and geodynamics (plate velocity, subduction angle, plate thickness, sediment thickness, crustal structure, subduction duration, and others) vary considerably among presently active subduction zones worldwide [e.g., @syracuse2010; @syracuse2006].

Intuition suggests subduction zone inputs and thermo-kinematic boundary conditions should influence mechanical behavior along the plate interface. Yet previous work argues for rather uniform depths of plate (de)coupling among subduction zones with diverse thermo-kinematic boundary conditions [@furukawa1993; @wada2008; @wada2009]. Models based on such uniform mechanical behavior are widely adopted over alternative models [after @syracuse2010] and imply some aspects of subduction zone mechanics are minimally affected by thermo-kinematic boundary conditions. However, the spatial variability (with depth *and* along strike in map view) of plate interface mechanics is difficult to quantify and currently characterized for transects across relatively few subduction zone segments compared to the global extent of actively converging margins.

This dissertation is motivated by the following question. How can one quantify the spatial variability of plate interface mechanical behavior across a range of subduction zones? Each chapter focuses on quantifying an aspect of subduction zone mechanics using different computational approaches and datasets.

Chapter \@ref(chpt2) numerically simulates oceanic-continental subduction across a range of thermo-kinematic boundary conditions and plate coupling is observed after 10 $Ma$. Multivariate linear regression is then used to formulate an expression for estimating coupling depth. The expression requires estimates for upper-plate thickness, which can be inverted from surface heat flow. Average upper-plate surface heat flow for 13 presently active subduction zones yield a narrow distribution of coupling depths---supporting the idea of broadly uniform mechanical coupling depths among subduction zones.

Chapter \@ref(chpt3) takes a closer look surface heat flow by quantifying its spatial variability in 2D. Two interpolations methods, Kriging and Similarity, are compared to assess differences in their regional heat flow predictions near subduction zones. While Kriging and Similarity yield comparable regional interpolations on average, both approaches show lateral (along strike) surface heat flow variability in the upper plate. Discontinuous upper-plate surface heat flow implies non-uniform upper-plate thickness and contradicts broadly uniform coupling depths predicted in Chapter \@ref(chpt2).

Finally, Chapter \@ref(chpt4) applies machine learning techniques to recognize detachment of subducting markers (representing recovered rock fragments) from the numerical simulations in Chapter \@ref(chpt2). A large (`r format(nrow(marx.class.summary[marx.class.summary$rec,]), big.mark = ',')`) \glsfirst{ptt} dataset of recovered markers is compared across numerical experiments and with a global compilation of \gls{pt} estimates for rocks exhumed from subduction zones (the rock record). Marker \gls{ptt} distributions are distinct from the rock record for most numerical simulations, except for the most slowly-converging systems (40 $km/Ma$). Both marker \gls{ptt} distributions and marker recovery rates correlate with thermo-kinematic boundary conditions, implying non-uniform mechanical detachment of rock among subduction zones.

## Abstract {#chpt2Abstract}

Deep mechanical coupling between converging plates is implicated in dynamic plate motions, crustal deformation, seismic cycles, arc magmatism, detachment (recovery) of subducting material, and is considered a key feature of subduction zone geodynamics. This study uses two-dimensional numerical simulations of oceanic-continental convergent margins to investigate effects of thermo-kinematic boundary conditions on coupling---specifically focusing on thermal parameter ($\Phi$) and upper-plate thickness. Numerical simulations implement coupling by including the metamorphic (de)hydration reaction $antigorite \allowbreak \Leftrightarrow olivine + orthopyroxene + H_{2}O$ in the upper-plate mantle. Visualizing P-T-strain fields show thermal feedbacks regulating coupling depth dynamically with strong responses to upper-plate thickness and weak responses to $\Phi$. The results imply estimation of coupling depth is possible by inverting upper-plate thickness from surface heat flow. Moreover, surface heat flow sampled from the backarc region near 17 presently active subduction zones imply uniform upper-plate thickness, and thus uniform coupling depths among subduction zones.

## Introduction {#chpt2Intro}

Subduction geodynamics are largely defined by plate motions and mechanical behavior along the plate interface. For example, a transition from mechanically decoupled (plates moving differentially with respect to each other) to coupled plates (plates moving with the same local velocity) dramatically increases temperature by inducing mantle circulation in the upper-plate asthenospheric mantle [@peacock1994; @peacock1996]. Observations from numerical simulations and forearc surface heat flow imply coupling transitions occur globally within a narrow range of depths in modern subduction zones (70-80 $km$). Further, coupling appears essentially unresponsive to diverse thermo-kinematic boundary conditions, including oceanic-plate age, convergence velocity, and subduction geometry [@furukawa1993; @wada2008; @wada2009]. While uniform coupling depths among subduction zones are inferred from numerical simulations and surface heat flow, this phenomenon remains curious and unconfirmed to a large extent. To understand subduction zone geodynamics, it is essential to understand why modern subduction zones appear to achieve similar coupling depths despite differences in their physical characteristics.

Notwithstanding, many numerical geodynamic models use coupling depths of 70-80 $km$ as a boundary condition [@abers2017; @currie2004; @syracuse2010; @vankeken2011; @vankeken2018; @wada2012; @gao2014; @wilson2014], although not exclusively [e.g. 40-56 $km$, @england2010; @peacock1996]. Similar coupling depths among subduction zones is an attractive hypothesis for at least two reasons. First, it helps explain a relatively narrow range of depths to subducting oceanic-plates beneath volcanic arcs [@england2004; @syracuse2006] as mechanical coupling is expected to be closely associated with the onset of flux melting. Second, mechanical coupling is required to detach crustal fragments from the subducting plate [@agard2016], so uniform coupling depths may also help explain why maximum pressures recorded by subducted oceanic material worldwide is $\leq$ 2.3-2.5 $GPa$ [roughly 80 $km$, @agard2009; @agard2018].

The location and extent of mechanical coupling along the plate interface is implicated in myriad geodynamic phenomena, including seismicity, metamorphism, volatile flux, volcanism, plate motions, and crustal deformation [@cizkova2013; @gonzalez2016; @hirauchi2010; @peacock1990; @peacock1991; @peacock1993; @peacock1996; @peacock1999a; @hacker2003; @vankeken2011; @grove2012; @gao2017]. Consequently, the mechanics of coupling have been extensively studied and discussed. Coupling fundamentally depends on the strength (viscosity) of materials above, within, and below the plate interface. Water flux from compaction and dehydration of hydrous minerals with increasing \glsfirst{pt} forms layers of low viscosity sheet silicates near the plate interface. Transmission of shear stress between plates is inhibited by formation of talc and serpentine in the shallow upper-plate mantle [@peacock1999a]. Lack of traction along the interface, combined with cooling from the subducting plate surface, ensures a positive feedback between hydrous mineral formation and mechanical decoupling. Experimentally determined flow laws, petrologic observations, and geophysical observations all support the plausibility of this conceptual model of subduction interface behavior [e.g., @agard2016; @agard2018; @gao2014; @peacock1999a].

Experimental control over important thermo-kinematic boundary conditions make geodynamic numerical simulations essential for investigating such complex geodynamic environments. @wada2009 previously investigated the effects of $\Phi$ on coupling depths by numerically simulating 17 presently active subduction zones. Among other thermo-kinematic boundary conditions, their models specify convergence rate, subduction geometry, thermal structure of oceanic- and overriding-plates, and degree of coupling along the subduction interface. Notably, their experiments control for interface rheology and discriminate best-fit coupling depths based on observed forearc surface heat flow.

This study similarly specifies thermo-kinematic boundary conditions to numerically simulate the range of modern subduction zone systems, but regulates interface rheology dynamically by implementing metamorphic reactions that respond to evolving P-T-strain fields. Subduction geometry and coupling depth are not fully determined features, in other words, but spontaneous model outcomes within the range of specified boundary conditions discussed in Section \@ref(numMethods). As in previous studies [e.g., @ruh2015], rheological effects of the dehydration reaction $antigorite \allowbreak \Leftrightarrow olivine + orthopyroxene + H_{2}O$ are implemented to drive mechanical coupling. An abrupt viscosity increase accompanies antigorite (serpentine) destabilization, thereby inducing mechanical coupling, as defined by empirically-determined flow laws used in the experiments (Table \@ref(tab:materials)).

This chapter focuses on two fundamental questions. How does coupling depth respond to $\Phi$ *and* upper-plate thickness? And how stable is coupling depth through time? First, 64 convergent margins with variable upper-plate thickness and $\Phi$ are numerically simulated and mechanical plate coupling is observed. Thermal feedbacks within the system are visualized in terms of mantle temperature, viscosity, and velocity fields and coupling depth responses to a range of $\Phi$ and upper-plate thickness are quantified using multivariate linear regression. Three different regression models are then used to estimate coupling depths for 17 presently active subduction zones. Coupling depth estimates are narrowly distributed, regardless of regression model form. Finally, implications and questions regarding uniformity among subduction zones in terms of surface heat flow, upper-plate thickness, and coupling depth are discussed.

## Numerical Modelling Methods {#numMethods}

This study simulates converging oceanic-continental plates, where an ocean basin is being consumed by subduction at a continental margin (Figure \@ref(fig:init)). Initial conditions are modified from previous numerical experiments of active margins [@sizova2010; @gorczyk2007] using the code `I2VIS` [@gerya2003], although plate coupling was not the focus of their studies. An identical rheologic model with identical material properties (Table \@ref(tab:materials)), and a identical hydration/melt model (Table \@ref(tab:melts) & Appendix \@ref(deHydration)) to @sizova2010 are implemented. However, the version of `I2VIS` in this study differs from @sizova2010 in its initial setup, overall dimension, resolution, continental geotherm, dehydration model, and left boundary condition (origin of new oceanic lithosphere). Differences are outlined in this section and in Appendix \@ref(deHydration). Sixty-four `I2VIS` models constructed with varying convergence rates ($\vec{v}$), oceanic-plate ages, and upper-plate thickness (Figure \@ref(fig:params)) were ran on the [Euler cluster](https://scicomp.ethz.ch/wiki/Euler) at ETH, Z√ºrich for at least 100 timesteps.

### Initial Setup and Boundary Conditions {#numBCs}

Simulations are 2000 $km$ wide and 300 $km$ deep (Figure \@ref(fig:init)). In the model domain, three governing equations of heat transport, momentum, and continuity are discretized and solved with a conservative finite-difference marker-in-cell approach on a fully staggered grid as outlined in @gerya2003. Numerical resolution is non-uniform with higher resolution (1 $km$ x 1 $km$) in a 600 $km$ wide area surrounding the contact between the oceanic-plate and continental margin, then gradually changing to lower resolution towards the model boundaries (5 $km$ x 1 $km$, x- and z-directions, respectively). The left and right boundaries are free-slip and thermally insulating (Figure \@ref(fig:init)a, b). Implementation of "sticky" air and water allows for a free topographical surface with a simple linear sedimentation and erosion model. The lower boundary is open to allow for oceanic-plate descent with a spontaneous subduction angle [@burg2005].

A horizontal convergence force is applied to both plates in a rectangular region far from the continental margin (Figure \@ref(fig:init)c). An initial weak layer cutting the lithosphere permits subduction to initiate. The high-viscosity ($\eta = 10^{25}~Pa\cdot s$) rectangular convergence regions apply constant horizontal velocities without deforming the lithosphere. Subduction angle is governed by free-motion of the subducting plate. Similarly, subduction velocity varies with time in response to extension or shortening of the overriding plate. $\Phi$ is thus calculated as the product of the horizontal convergence velocity and the oceanic-plate age [c.f. @kirby1991; @mckenzie1969]. For convenience and consistency with the literature, this study presents $\Phi$ in units of $km$/100 (Figure \@ref(fig:params)a).

### Defining Geotherms and Lithospheric Thickness {#numGeotherms}

Oceanic crust is modeled as 1 $km$ of sediment cover overlying 2 $km$ of basalt and 5 $km$ of gabbro (Figure \@ref(fig:init)a). Oceanic lithosphere is continually made at a pseudo-mid-ocean ridge at the left boundary of the model (Figure \@ref(fig:init)b). An enhanced vertical cooling condition applied at 200 $km$ from left boundary adjusts for the proper oceanic-plate age, and therefore its lithospheric thickness as it enters the trench [@agrusta2013]. Oceanic-plate ages range from 32.6 to 110 $Ma$ and convergence velocities from 40 to 100 $km/Ma$ (Figure \@ref(fig:params)a). This range of parameters broadly reflects the middle-range of modern global subduction systems [@syracuse2006].

Initial continental geotherms are determined by solving the heat flow equation in one-dimension to 1300 $^{\circ}C$ (Figure \@ref(fig:params)b). This study assumes a fixed temperature of 0 $^{\circ}C$ at the surface, constant radiogenic heating of 1 $\mu W/m^{3}$ in the 35 $km$-thick continental crust, 0.022 $\mu W/m^{3}$ in the mantle, with thermal conductivities of 2.3 $W/mK$ and 3.0 $W/mK$ for the continental crust and mantle, respectively. Above, 1300 $^{\circ}C$, temperature is assumed to constantly increase by 0.5 $^{\circ}C/km$ (the mantle adiabat) to the base of the model domain.

Many studies define the base of the continental lithosphere at the 1300 $^{\circ}C$ isotherm, but it can be determined directly by visualizing viscosity and strain rate as the model progresses. The mechanical base of the lithosphere ($Z_{UP}$) in the models generally occurs near the 1100 $^{\circ}C$ isotherm---characterized by a rapid decrease in viscosity and increase in strain rate (Figures \@ref(fig:cdfStep1), \@ref(fig:cdfStep2), \@ref(fig:cdfStep3)). As such, this study considers oceanic and continental lithospheres as mechanical layers defined by viscosity, rather than defined merely by temperature. $Z_{UP}$ corresponding to backarc surface heat flow of 59, 63, 69, and 79 $mW/m^{2}$ are used in this study (Figure \@ref(fig:params)b).

### Metamorphic (De)hydration Reactions {#numHydration}

Using Lagrangian markers [@harlow1962; @harlow1964] to store and update material properties and P-T-strain fields allows for straight-forward numerical implementation of metamorphic reactions. This approach is key to regulating mechanical coupling dynamically in subduction zone simulations. For example, dehydration (eclogitization) of the oceanic-plate and (de)stabilization of serpentine in the upper-plate mantle may be effectively modelled by tracing marker \gls{ptt} paths while changing marker properties according to thermodynamically-stable mineral assemblages [e.g., @connolly2005]. For computational efficiency, however, water contents in this study are not computed by iteratively solving thermodynamic systems of equations. Instead, gradual eclogitization of oceanic crust is computed as a linear function of lithostatic pressure to a maximum depth of 150 $km$, or temperature of 1427 $^\circ C$, while including garnet-in and plagioclase-out reactions defined by @ito1971. Mantle (de)hydration is computed according reactions boundaries defined by @schmidt1998 with a maximum water content of 2 $wt.\%$ (explained below). This approach effectively simulates continuous influx of water to the upper-plate mantle with relatively low computational cost, beginning with compaction and release of connate water at shallow depths, followed by a sequence of reactions consuming major hydrous phases (chlorite, lawsonite, zoisite, chloritoid, talc, amphibole, and phengite) in different parts of the hydrated basaltic crust [@schmidt1998; @vankeken2011].

The extent of metamorphic reaction effects on mechanical coupling, and the exact (de)hydration reaction(s) likely responsible, are unknown. However, formation of brucite and serpentine from dry olivine near the plate interface are inferred to strongly regulate mechanical behavior [@hyndman2003; @peacock1999a; @agard2016]. Brucite notably breaks down at much lower temperatures than serpentine [@schmidt1998], so serpentine (de)stabilization arguably represents the key transition from a weak-to-strong upper-plate mantle deep in subduction zones. This study elects an implementation of serpentine (de)hydration for this reason. The reaction is assumed to be abrupt and discontinuous, which is a fine approximation for near-endmember compositions like (Mg-rich) peridotites. The \gls{pt} conditions of the reaction $antigorite \Leftrightarrow olivine + orthopyroxene + H_{2}O$ were numerically implemented by the following equation [after @schmidt1998]:
\begin{equation}
  T_{atg-out}(z)=
  \begin{cases}
    751.50+6.008\times10^{-3}z-3.469\times10^{-8}z^2,& \text{for } z < 63000m \\
    1013.2-6.039\times10^{-5}z-4.289\times10{-9}z^2,& \text{for } z>63000m
  \end{cases}
  (\#eq:antstab)
\end{equation}
where $z$ is the depth of a marker from the surface in meters and $T$ is temperature in Kelvins. This reaction boundary is consistent to within 25 $^{\circ}C$ of more recent experiments by @shen2015. Markers with internal temperature exceeding $T_{atg-out}(z)$ spontaneously form $olivine + orthopyroxene + H_{2}O$ and release their crystal-bound water. This implementation tacitly assumes thermodynamic equilibrium and is common to many versions of `I2VIS`.

Oceanic-plates of different ages are also tacitly assumed to dehydrate similarly with the above implementation. However, older (colder) oceanic-plates are expected to carry water to greater depths than younger (warmer) plates because of relatively delayed water-releasing reactions [@peacock1996]. Abrupt water release with serpentine dehydration (Equation \@ref(eq:antstab)) was tested to model deep water retention in cold oceanic-plates. Mechanical coupling behavior was indistinguishable from gradual water release models. This implies rates of water release are less important than the depth of serpentine stability. Explicitly modelling other major dehydration reactions are thus unlikely to significantly affect mechanical coupling behavior, yet likely to introduce numerical artifacts at great computational cost. A simplified gradual water release model for all oceanic-plates is therefore preferred.

Water released by rock forms discrete fluid particles that migrate with relative velocities defined by local deviatoric (non-lithostatic) pressure gradients [see Appendix \@ref(deHydration), @faccenda2009]. Fluid velocities are scaled by a 10 $cm/yr$ vertical percolation velocity to account for purely lithostatic pressure gradients in the mantle [@gorczyk2007]. Fluid particles migrate until encountering rock that can consume additional water by equilibrium hydration or melting reactions, (Equation \@ref(tab:melts)).

The shallow upper-plate mantle can theoretically store large amounts of water as serpentine may contain up to 13 $wt.\%$ water [@reynard2013] and is generally stable at shallow mantle conditions. Thermodynamic models predict 8 $wt.\%$ water in the shallow upper-plate mantle [@connolly2005]. However, seismic studies suggest most shallow upper-plate mantles are only partially serpentinized (< 20-40%), equating to water contents of approximately 3-6 $wt.\%$ [@abers2017; @carlson2003]. Many modes of mantle hydration are documented or inferred, including evidence for channelized fluid flow within ophiolites exhumed from subduction zones [@angiboust2012a; @angiboust2014; @zack2007; @plumper2017]. This study limits mantle wedge hydration to $\leq$ 2 $wt.\%~H_{2}O$ and assumes any excess $H_{2}O$ exits the system through channelized fluid flow during plastic or brittle deformation [@davies1999].

### Rheologic Model {#rheologicModel}

Contributions from dislocation and diffusion creep are accounted for by computing a composite rheology for ductile rocks, $\eta_{effective}$:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \frac{1}{\eta_{effective}} = \frac{1}{\eta_{diff}} + \frac{1}{\eta_{disl}}
  \end{aligned} 
  (\#eq:ductile)
\end{equation}
where $\eta_{diff}$ and $\eta_{disl}$ are effective viscosities for diffusion and dislocation creep. For the crust and serpentinized mantle, $\eta_{diff}$ and $\eta_{disl}$ are computed as:

where $R$ is the gas constant, $P$ is pressure, $T$ is temperature in $K$, ${\dot{\varepsilon}}_{II} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}{{\dot{\varepsilon}}_{ij}}^{2}}$ is the square root of the second invariant of the strain rate tensor, $\sigma_{crit}$ is an assumed diffusion-dislocation transition stress, and $A$, $E$, $V$ and $n$ are the material constant, activation energy, activation volume, and stress exponent, respectively [Table \@ref(tab:materials), @hilairet2007; @ranalli1995].

Viscosity is limited in all numerical experiments from $\eta_{min} = 10^{17}\ Pa \cdot s$ to $\eta_{max} = 10^{25}\ Pa \cdot s$. An effective visco-plastic rheology is achieved by limiting $\eta_{effective}$ with a brittle (plastic) yield criterion:
\begin{equation}
  \eta_{effective} \leq \frac{C + \phi \ P}{2 \ \dot{\varepsilon}_{II}}
  (\#eq:plastic)
\end{equation}
where $\phi$ is the internal friction coefficient, $C$ cohesive strength at $P$ = 0, and ${\dot{\varepsilon}}_{ij}$ is the strain rate tensor (Table \@ref(tab:materials)).

### Visualization and Determination of Coupling Depth

The rheologic model and thermo-kinematic boundary conditions described in the previous sections always results in plate motions towards the left boundary (slab-rollback). Relatively high dip angles and extreme subduction velocities in some high-$\Phi$ experiments cause chaotic behavior by 10 $Ma$ as the upper-plate is stretched thin and mechanical interference occurs between trench sediments and the high-viscosity convergence region 200 $km$ from the left boundary. Numerical solutions are stable for most experiments, however, reaching quasi-steady state by 5 $Ma$. An additional 5 $Ma$ is allowed to ensure stable geodynamics before observing coupling depth. Surface heat flow, rock type, temperature, viscosity, strain rate, shear heating, and velocity fields are visualized at approximately 10 $Ma$ (e.g. Figure \@ref(fig:comp)) for all 64 experiments to assess geodynamics and solution stability (Figure \@ref(fig:antDepth)).

```{r comp, fig.cap='Visualizing model cdf with a 78 $km$ upper-plate lithosphere at approximately 10 $Ma$. (a) Rock type shows a thin serpentine layer (pink) lubricating the plate interface. Note that low melt volumes are inconspicuous and quickly extracted. (b) Viscosity shows high contrast between the oceanic-plate and serpentinized upper-plate mantle at shallow levels. Viscosity contrast disappears where serpentine becomes unstable. (c) Streamlines show focused mantle flow towards the interface, coinciding with the lower limit of serpentine stability. Note the converging isotherms that imply a feedback between heat transfer, serpentine destabilization, and mechanical coupling. (d) Strain rate shows localized deformation in the serpentine layer along the plate interface. Note that deformation in the upper-plate mantle is restricted to viscous flow beneath the lithosphere and along narrow, subvertical melt conduits. Rock type colors are the same as Figure 1.', fig.scap='Numerical experiment visualization'}

```

After approximately 10 $Ma$ of subduction coupling depth is determined directly from viscosity by finding the approximate area where strength contrasts between serpentinized- and non-serpentinized upper-plate mantle diminishes to $<$ 10$^2$ $Pa \cdot s$. The node nearest to this region is assigned as the coupling depth. This study assumes mechanical coupling occurs instantaneously and at a single node. Mechanical coupling in reality must be dispersed across a finite length along the plate interface, however. At the numerical resolution the experiments, coupling-like viscosity contrasts are similar within a small area (approximately 5 $\times$ 5 $km$ or 5 $\times$ 5 nodes), giving a qualitative uncertainty coupling depth on the order of 2.5 $km$.

## Results {#chpt2Results}

### Coupling Depth Estimators {#cdEstimators}

Coupling depth ($Z_{cpl}$) correlates strongly with upper-plate thickness ($Z_{UP}$) and weakly with $\Phi$ across all 64 numerical models (Table \@ref(tab:zcResults), Figures \@ref(fig:results) & \@ref(fig:biv)). The responsiveness of coupling depth to $Z_{UP}$ but not to $\Phi$ is a key result of this study. The following equation minimizes standard least squares while optimizing the number of parameters, *p value*, and $R^2$ for all possible permutations of the variables $Z_{UP}$ and $\Phi$ in linear and quadratic forms:
\begin{equation}
  Z_{cpl} = 4.95\times 10^{-3}\ Z_{UP}^{2}\ -\ 9.27\times 10^{-2}\ \Phi\ +\ 63.6
  (\#eq:zCpl)
\end{equation}
where $Z_{cpl}$ is coupling depth in $km$ and $\Phi$ is the thermal parameter in $km/100$. Regression summaries show both linear and quadratic models of $Z_{cpl}$ vs. $Z_{UP}$ and $\Phi$ fit experimental results well (Tables \@ref(tab:anova) & \@ref(tab:regSummary)). Equation \@ref(eq:zCpl) represents a statistical model formulated with observations from physics-based simulations of subduction. Equation \@ref(eq:zCpl) is useful for estimating coupling depths in active subduction zones where $\Phi$ is known and $Z_{UP}$ can be inverted from surface heat flow.

Sensitivity of coupling depth to upper-plate thickness and $\Phi$ is apparent when visualizing Equation \@ref(eq:zCpl) and other regression models across $Z_{UP}$ and $\Phi$ space \@ref(fig:multiv). Applying Equation \@ref(eq:zCpl) to 17 active subduction zone segments (Table \@ref(tab:segs)) gives a wide range of estimated coupling depths, similar to the numerical simulations in this study. The distribution of estimated coupling depths, however, is relatively narrow and quasi-normal, with a mean of $\sim$ 82 $km$ and standard deviation of 7 $km$ (Figure \@ref(fig:multiv)d).

```{r multiv, fig.cap='Multivariate regressions and estimated coupling depth ($Z_{cpl}$) for 17 active subduction zone segments. Contoured plots show estimated $Z_{cpl}$ (contours) as a function of thermal parameter ($\\Phi$) and upper-plate thickness ($Z_{UP}$) for linear (a) and quadratic (b, c) regressions.

### Surface Heat Flow

Upper-plate surface heat flow remains relatively stable and reflects initial upper-plate geotherms in the backarc region for experiments with low to moderate $\Phi$ (Figure \@ref(fig:hf)). However, high-amplitude and high-frequency positive surface heat flow deviations in the upper-plate are common in all experiments, especially for high-$\Phi$ experiments. These deviations correspond to extensional deformation and heat transport via lithospheric thinning and melt migration. These features are apparent as subvertical low viscosity, high strain rate columns originating from the plate interface (Figure \@ref(fig:comp)b, d) and point to potential sources of error when inverting surface heat flow in active subduction zones. Notably, the backarc is relatively unaffected by fluid and melt migration compared to the forearc. Estimating upper-plate thickness by inverting surface heat flow in the backarc is therefore preferable to forearc surface heat flow.

Surface heat flow across all numerical experiments is similar in the forearc region (normalized distance $\leq$ 0.75, Figure \@ref(fig:hf78)). In contrast, surface heat flow extending behind the arc region (normalized distance $>$ 0.75, Figure \@ref(fig:hf78)) increases systematically, then levels off at values reflecting initial continental geotherms (i.e. reflecting initial upper-plate thickness). In reality, surface heat flow depend on fault slip rates and rates of volcanic outputs. However, heat flow in the behind the arc may remain in steady-state if rates of volcanism and crustal thinning by extension are low [@currie2004; @currie2006].

```{r hf78, fig.cap='Surface heat flow ($\\vec{q}$) vs. normalized distance for model cdf with upper-plate thickness ($Z_{UP}$) ranging from 46 to 94 $km$. The distribution of $\\vec{q}$ in the forearc (normalized distance between 0.0 and 1.0) is narrow and shows little variance until near the arc (normalized distance between 0.75 and 1.0). The broad distribution of $\\vec{q}$ behind the arc (normalized distance $>$ 1.0) reflects the broad distribution of initial continental geotherms ($Z_{UP}$). Any simple relationship between $\\vec{q}$ and $Z_{UP}$ may be obscured by heating from extension or vertical migration of fluids, especially within the arc-region (high-amplitude fluctuations).', fig.scap='Surface heat flow calculated from numerical experiments'}

## Discussion {#chpt2Discussion}

### Dynamic Feedbacks Regulating Plate Coupling

A clear association between plate coupling and the reaction $antigorite \allowbreak \Leftrightarrow olivine + orthopyroxene + H_{2}O$ is observed in all experiments. A relatively narrow serpentine channel quickly forms above the dehydrating oceanic-plate, localizing strain, lubricating the plate interface, and inhibiting transfer of shear stress between plates [e.g., @agard2016; @ruh2015]. This mechanical behavior is a direct consequence of a sharp rheologic change dependent on the location of serpentine dehydration reaction described in Section \@ref(numHydration) and its effect on the rheologic model described in Section \@ref(rheologicModel). Interactions among viscosity changes, serpentine dehydration, and heat transfer are regulated by competing dynamic feedbacks acting in the upper-plate. In summary, cooling and hydration of the shallow upper-plate mantle (serpentine stabilization) and heating from circulating asthenospheric mantle beneath the upper-plate lithosphere (driven by mechanical coupling) compete to stabilize coupling depth (Figure \@ref(fig:flow)).

The entire process can be conceptualized with Figure \@ref(fig:flow) as follows. The upper-plate mantle cools via diffusive heat loss to the oceanic-plate along the entire length of the plate interface (Figure \@ref(fig:flow)a). At shallow depths, water released from the oceanic-plate stabilizes serpentine in the overriding upper-plate mantle, effectively decoupling the two plates (Figure \@ref(fig:flow)b, point a). A positive feedback stabilizes serpentine to greater depths as decoupled plates stagnate the upper-plate mantle, promoting further cooling and formation of serpentine. Numerical experiments imply only a thin layer of serpentine is sufficient to trigger this feedback.

```{r flow, fig.cap='Visualizing viscosity and mantle flow near the coupling region at approximately 10 $Ma$ for model cdf with upper-plate thickness of 78 $km$. Strong mantle flow beneath the lithospheric base (1100$^{\\circ}C$) transfers heat towards the coupling region. Viscosity indicates coupling at the point where the viscosity contrast between the slab and mantle approaches zero (between points b \\& d). Reference points a-e are used for discussing coupling dynamics and thermal feedbacks (see Section \\ref{cplResponses}).', fig.scap='Visualizing viscosity and mantle flow'}

knitr::include_graphics('assets/figs/chpt2/fig6.png')

```

Deeper along the plate interface, beyond the stability of serpentine, diffusive heat loss from the upper-plate mantle to the slab forms a thickening layer of high-viscosity mantle atop the oceanic-plate (Figure \@ref(fig:flow)b, point b). Downward motion of the oceanic-plate, plus accreted high-viscosity mantle (Figure \@ref(fig:flow)b, point b) relative to the deepest extent of the stiff upper-plate mantle (Figure \@ref(fig:flow)b, point c) creates a pressure gradient that attracts flow of the weakest materials---serpentine from the up-dip direction (Figure \@ref(fig:flow)b, point d)---and hot mantle from below (Figure \@ref(fig:flow)b, point e). Flow of hot mantle into the necking region between points b and c in Figure \@ref(fig:flow) is analogous to passive asthenospheric upwelling toward a mid-ocean ridge where two strong cooling lithospheric plates diverge. Highly efficient heat advection from the warm upper-plate asthenospheric mantle (Figure \@ref(fig:flow)a) prevents formation of sperentine---thus regulating and stabilizing the coupling depth.

Coupling mechanics apparent from numerical experiments can be described in terms of competing positive and negative feedbacks. The positive feedback involves addition of water into a diffusively cooling, shallow mantle to produce serpentine. The negative feedback involves serpentine destabilization by advection of heat from the deeper upper-plate asthenospheric mantle. Such thermal-petrologic-mechanical feedbacks drive coupling depth towards steady-state. The numerical experiments in this study imply a finely-tuned balance of serpentine stability can maintain coupling depths in subduction zones for potentially 10's of Ma.

### Coupling Responses to $Z_{UP}$ and $\Phi$ {#cplResponses}

How does upper-plate thickness influence coupling depth? Numerical experiments point to the upper-plate lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary as an important feature constraining coupling mechanics as it defines the permissible flow field in the upper-plate (Figure \@ref(fig:streams)a-d). Thin upper-plate lithospheres (Figure \@ref(fig:streams)a, b) permit shallow mantle flow and advection of heat farther up the plate interface. Thin upper-plate lithospheres thereby raise coupling depths by raising serpentine stability up the plate interface. Thick upper-plate lithospheres (Figure \@ref(fig:streams)c, d) restrict mantle wedge flow to deeper levels, deepening serpentine stability and mechanical coupling.

The thermal state of the slab, as represented by $\Phi$, has almost no effect on coupling depth by comparison. Relative insensitivity of coupling depth to $\Phi$ is consistent with previous studies of active subduction zones [@furukawa1993; @wada2009]. The irresponsiveness of coupling depth to changes in $\Phi$ is perhaps  due to competing cooling and heating effects driven by the subducting oceanic-plate. For example, high-$\Phi$ oceanic-plates (older plates with higher velocities) cool the upper-plate mantle more effectively, but also effectively heat the interface by driving stronger mantle circulation. In contrast, low-$\Phi$ oceanic-plates (younger plates with lower velocities) are less effective in cooling the upper-plate mantle, but also ineffectively heat the interface by ineffectively driving mantle circulation. That is, the shallow vs. deep dynamic effects of $\Phi$ tend to cancel each other, explaining the lack of correlation between coupling depth and $\Phi$.

### Estimating Coupling Depths in Subduction Zones

Theoretically, coupling depth can be estimated directly by fitting forearc surface heat flow data using forward modelling approaches [e.g., @wada2009]. However, forward approaches typically adjust coupling depth independently from upper-plate thickness, which is inconsistent with an inherent link between coupling depth and upper-plate thickness discussed in Section \@ref(chpt2Discussion) (e.g. Figures \@ref(fig:hf78) & \@ref(fig:streams)). Moreover, many additional heat sources [e.g. shear heating and crustal plutonism, @gao2014; @reesjones2018] may contribute to forearc surface heat flow---increasing uncertainty when inverting upper-plate thickness from surface heat flow.

Assuming low degrees of backarc extension, estimating coupling depth in active subduction zones using Equation \@ref(eq:zCpl) with $Z_{UP}$ inverted from backarc surface heat flow is preferable to avoid additional uncertainties stemming from seismic and volcanic activity in the forearc. However, while $\Phi$ is inventoried for most active subduction zones [@syracuse2006], a corresponding dataset of $Z_{UP}$ does not exist. Several geophysical and petrologic methods might be considered for independent estimates of $Z_{UP}$ (e.g. seismic velocities, flexure, heat flow, mantle xenoliths). Backarc surface heat flow is still a good choice, however, because of its direct correspondence with $Z_{UP}$. For example, $Z_{UP}$ may be estimated using simple one-dimensional heat transport models assuming values for radiogenic heat production in the crust [@rudnick1998]. Special attention must be paid to crustal processes, including extension and magmatism, because additional heating will underestimate $Z_{UP}$ and, consequently, underestimate coupling depth.

```{r streams, fig.cap='Visualizing mantle flow at approximately 10 $Ma$ for model cdf with upper-plate thickness of (a) 46, (b) 62, (c) 78, and (d) 94 $km$. All experiments are plotted on the same scale and location within the model domain. The flow of warm mantle is restricted to below the 1100$^{\\circ}C$ isotherm, which corresponds to the base of the upper-plate lithosphere ($Z_{UP}$). A minimum coupling depth ($Z_{cpl}$) appears to exist as models with extremely thin lithospheres (a) exhibit coupling at $\\sim$ 70-80 $km$ depth. $Z_{cpl}$ generally increases with increasing $Z_{UP}$ as mantle flow and advective heat transport are restricted to greater depths.', fig.scap='Visualizing mantle flow and coupling by upper-plate thickness'}

### Globally Similar Coupling Depths?

A $Z_{cpl}$ distribution of 82 $\pm$ 14 $km$ (2$\sigma$) estimated for active subduction zones in this study (Figure \@ref(fig:multiv)d) roughly match the preferred $Z_{cpl}$ inferred from forearc surface heat flow for Cascadia and NE Japan [75-80 $km$, @syracuse2010; @wada2009] $km$. The range of $Z_{cpl}$ estimated for active subduction zones in this study (Figure \@ref(fig:multiv)d) is relatively broad, however. For example, omitting Mexico and Nankai because their $\Phi$ values fall outside the range of $\Phi$ used for numerical experiments, estimated coupling depths range from almost 100 $km$ (Kyushu) to approximately 65 $km$ (Sumatra and NE Japan, Table \@ref(tab:segs)).

Coupling depth in active subduction zones are commonly assumed to be narrowly distributed around 70-80 $km$ [@wada2009; @syracuse2010]. The strong correlation between $Z_{UP}$ and $Z_{cpl}$ found from numerical experiments imply uniform coupling depths are possible if upper-plate thickness are globally uniform. The surface heat flow dataset compiled by @wada2009 (Table \@ref(tab:segs)) shows average backarc surface heat flow are indeed similar among active subduction zones---implying a narrow distribution of coupling depths (Figure \@ref(fig:multiv)d). Much of their dataset is based on @currie2006, who estimate upper-plate thickness for 10 circum-Pacific subduction zones of 50-60 $km$ (defined by the 1200 $^{\circ}C$ isotherm). Uniformly thin upper-plate thickness are corroborated by uniformly high heat flow ($>$ 70 $mW/m^{2}$), thermobarometric constraints on mantle xenoliths, and P-wave velocities [@currie2006]. An attempt is made to further corroborate the uniformity of upper-plate thickness in Chapter \@ref(chpt3) by interpolating surface heat flow near active subduction zones.

Although it still curious why upper-plates among subduction zones may have similar thicknesses, one can assume it is likely related to some processes of lithospheric erosion proposed for subarc lithosphere. These include: lithospheric delamination induced by lower crust eclogitization [@sobolev2005], small-scale convection caused by hydration-induced mantle wedge weakening [@arcay2006], thermal erosion [@england2010], mechanical weakening by percolating melts [@gerya2011], and subarc foundering of magmatic cumulates [@jull2001]. Most of these mechanisms are thus strongly related to mantle wedge hydration, melting, and melt transport toward volcanic arcs.

The metamorphic rock record may also imply consistency among coupling depths in subduction zones. For example, the demise of a serpentine channel and onset of coupling may provide a natural barrier such that rocks are more likely to be exhumed from within the channel than from below it. The relative abundance of blueschists and eclogites should then be greater for pressures below estimated coupling depths (approximately 2.4 $GPa$ or 70-80 $km$) than above them. This hypothesis will be explicitly explored in Chapter \@ref(chpt4). 

## Conclusions

Three important results are highlighted in this study:

1. Coupling depth is stabilized near the base of the upper-plate lithosphere by competing dynamic feedbacks regulating heat transport, serpentine dehydration, and mechanical coupling in the upper-plate mantle.
2. A simple expression fitted to coupling depths observed in numerical experiments allows the coupling depths to be estimated for active subduction zones by inverting upper-plate thickness from surface heat flow.
3. Uniform surface heat flow in circum-Pacific subduction zones [@currie2006; @wada2009] may indicate uniform coupling depths at approximately 80 $km$.

Questions remain, however, including: how do warm (thin) upper-plates persist over 100's of kilometers behind arcs and throughout the lifespan of subduction zones? How abruptly are dehydration reaction occurring along the subduction interface? How can expressions like Equation \@ref(eq:zCpl) be improved using natural datasets? Each of these questions may be considered for future research.

The magnitude and spatial extent of heat fluxing through the Earth's surface depend on the integrated thermal state of Earth's lithosphere plus heat transferring subsurface processes. Surface heat flow observations are thus critically important for understanding thermal processing (e.g. by fluids, melts, and plate motions) of lithosphere at subduction zones. However, evaluating regional surface heat flow patterns across large tectonic features requires careful interpolation of sparse, irregularly-spaced observations over distances from 10$^{-1}$ to 10$^3$ $km$. This study compares two interpolation methods based on fundamentally different principles, *Similarity* and *Kriging*, to investigate spatial variability of surface heat flow near 13 presently active subduction zone segments. Profiles of Similarity and Kriging predictions across adjacent upper-plate sectors show diverse surface heat flow distributions among subduction zone segments and broad systematic changes along strike. Such a Kaleidoscope of profiles implies various degrees of (dis)continuity exist among subduction zone segments in terms of their lithospheric thermal structure, geodynamics, and/or observational density relative to the local (unknown) spatial variability of surface heat flow. Accuracy rates of Similarity and Kriging predictions are comparable among subduction zone segments, on average, implying either method as viable for subduction zone research. Anomalies and methodological idiosyncrasies identified by comparing independent interpolation methods aid in identifying future survey targets and developing more accurate regional surface heat flow interpolations.

## Introduction {#chpt3Intro}

The amount of heat escaping Earth's surface depends on the integrated thermal state of Earth's lithosphere, plus heat-transferring and heat-generating subsurface processes like hydrothermal circulation, radioactive decay, fault motion, and mantle convection [@fourier1827; @kelvin1863; @parsons1977; @pollack1977; @stein1992; @hutnak2008; @hasterok2013; @stein1994; @rudnick1998; @furlong2013; @gao2014; @furukawa1993; @wada2009; @kerswell2020; @currie2004; @currie2006]. Surface heat flow observations are thus critically important for understanding lithospheric evolution, crustal deformation and seismic hazards, groundwater hydrology and environmental impacts, and exploration of economic resources (e.g. hydrocarbon, mineral, and geothermal energy). Monumental efforts to take tens of thousands of continental and oceanic surface heat flow measurements (see [ThermoGlobe References](#tglobe) with 1,393 citations) and compile them into databases [@pollack1993; @hasterok2008; @lucazeau2019; @jennings2021] enable multi-disciplinary investigations of lithospheric and crustal processes.

The most recent global surface heat flow database, *ThermoGlobe* [@lucazeau2019; @jennings2021], currently contains `r format(nrow(hf), big.mark = ',')` observations. Yet the spatial coverage near subduction zones is relatively sparse (n = `r format(nrow(bind_rows(shp.hf.crop)), big.mark = ',')` for this study) and highly-irregular at the regional scale (10$^2$ to 10$^3$ $km$, see Figure \@ref(fig:globalhfComp) & Table \@ref(tab:hfSummaryTable)). Note that ThermoGlobe includes many datasets of high-resolution surface heat flow arrays, often collocated with seismic arrays, that span $\leq$ 10$^2$ $km$ in total length. While high-resolution surveys can resolve fine spatial variations in surface heat flow at the study site scale, probing surface heat flow variations along a subduction zone segment requires evaluation of ThermoGlobe data across larger-scales. Thus, the primary challenge in quantifying segment-scale surface heat flow variations is evaluating sparse, irregularly-spaced observations separated by distances from 10$^{-1}$ to 10$^3$ $km$. This study approaches the above problem by (1) interpolating irregularly-spaced ThermoGlobe data onto a regular grid, and then (2) sampling the interpolated surface heat flow across large adjacent regions in the upper-plate (upper-plate sectors).

(ref:globalhfCompCap) Regional surface heat flow near subduction zone segments. (a) ThermoGlobe data from @lucazeau2019 cropped within 1000 $km$-radius buffers around 13 active subduction zone segments show uneven regional coverage. For example, note the relatively high observational density in the NW Pacific compared to other regions.

The two interpolation methods compared in this study, *Kriging* and *Similarity*, are chosen because they represent end-member approaches based on fundamentally different principles and mathematical frameworks. Their comparative differences, therefore, may be important for understanding lithospheric thermal structure, identifying surface heat flow anomalies, evaluating practical limitations of each approach, and developing new methods combining the strengths of Kriging and Similarity techniques. The general rationale for applying Kriging and Similarity methods are embodied in the First and Third Laws of Geography, respectively:

> \uline{Three Laws of Geography}:
>
> | 1. Everything is related, but nearer things are more related
> |    [@krige1951; @matheron1963]
> | 2. Geographic phenomena are inherently heterogeneous
> |    [@goodchild2004]
> | 3. Localities with similar geographic configurations share other attributes
> |    [@zhu2018]

Generally speaking, the spatial continuity of surface heat flow reflects variations in lithospheric thermal structure and heat-transferring processes (neglecting variations in radiogenic heat production). For example, broad regions of low surface heat flow on continents outline cratons [@nyblade1993], anomalously low surface heat flow in oceanic crust imply significant heat extraction by seawater [@stein1994; @fisher2000; @hutnak2008; @hasterok2011], and trench-orthogonal surface heat flow profiles imply uniform upper-plate lithospheric thickness [@currie2004; @currie2006; @hyndman2005] and mechanical coupling depths [@furukawa1993; @wada2009; @kerswell2020] among subduction zones. For Kriging, such patterns and anomalies may be resolved (assuming adequate observational coverage) because Kriging estimation is inherently dependent on the spatial continuity of observed surface heat flow.

In contrast, Similarity may (or may not) impose different patterns than Kriging because the method only depends on the similarity between two localities in terms of their *geographic configuration* [the makeup and structure of geographic variables over some spatial neighbourhood around a point, @zhu2018]. Rather than interpolating (*sensu stricto*) like Kriging, Similarity predicts surface heat flow by comparing geographic, geologic, geochronologic, and geophysical information between a target point and the entire ThermoGlobe dataset [see @goutorbe2011 for method details]. In other words, Similarity predictions are fundamentally geologically-reasoned estimates of surface heat flow. For example, two localities have similar surface heat flow if they have similar bathymetry, lithology, proximity to active or ancient orogens, seafloor age, upper mantle shear wave velocity, etc. [@chapman1975; @lee1965; @sclater1970; @davies2013; @shapiro2004; @lucazeau2019].

This study compares regional Similarity and Kriging interpolations near 13 presently active subduction zones while considering the following questions: (1) how does surface heat flow vary near subduction zones, especially within the upper-plate? (2) How do Kriging and Similarity predictions compare? (3) What do the differences (if any) imply about geodynamic variability among active subduction zones? First, ordinary Kriging is applied to ThermoGlobe data near 13 presently active subduction zone segments [defined by @syracuse2006]. Kriging predictions are then directly compared (point-by-point) to Similarity predictions from a previous global-scale study by @lucazeau2019. Interpolation comparisons yield a Kaleidoscope of predicted upper-plate surface heat flow distributions and profiles. Potential implications of mixed upper-plate profiles are discussed, especially with respect to uniform lithospheric thickness presented in Chapter \@ref(chpt2).

## Methods {#chpt3Methods}

### The ThermoGlobe Database

The ThermoGlobe database is available from the supplementary material of @lucazeau2019 and is accessible online at \url{http://heatflow.org} [@jennings2021]. It currently contains `r format(nrow(hf), big.mark=',')` data points, their locations in latitude/longitude, and important metadata---including a data quality rank (`Code 6`) from A (high-quality) to D (low-quality). The reader is referred to @lucazeau2019 and \url{http://heatflow.org} for details on compilation, references, historical perspective on ThermoGlobe, and previous compilations. ThermoGlobe is the most recent database available, has been carefully compiled, and is open-access.

Like @lucazeau2019, `r format(sum(hf$code6 == 'D', na.rm = T), big.mark = ',')` poor quality observations (`Code 6` = D), `r sum(is.na(hf['hf']), na.rm = T)` data points without heat flow observations, and `r sum(is.na(hf$longitude), na.rm = T)+sum(is.na(hf$latitude), na.rm = T)` without geographic information are excluded from the analysis. Note that quality control of such a large dataset is an ongoing endeavor and `r format(sum(hf$code6=='Z', na.rm = T), big.mark=',')` observations currently have an undetermined quality (`Code 6` = Z). Duplicate observations at the same location are parsed (to avoid singular covariance matrices during Kriging) by selecting only the best quality measurement. If duplicate measurements are of equal quality, one is randomly chosen. Finally, surface heat flow observations for Kriging and Similarity predictions are both limited to the range (0 - 250] $mWm^{-2}$. Observations outside of the range (0 - 250] $mWm^{-2}$ are considered anomalous high [e.g. collected near geothermal systems, @lucazeau2019] and unrepresentative of lithospheric-scale thermal structure. Moreover, anomalously high observations constitute a small fraction of measurements (`r format(nrow(hf[hf$hf < 0 | hf$hf > 250,]), big.mark = ',')` out of `r format(nrow(hf), big.mark = ',')`) forming long tails on either side of the global surface heat flow distribution. The final dataset used for Kriging contains `r format(nrow(hf.crop), big.mark=',')` observations after filtering for quality, missing values, and heat flow range, parsing duplicate pairs, and cropping within subduction zone buffers (Figure \@ref(fig:hfSummaryPlot) & Table \@ref(tab:hfSummaryTable)).

### Map Projection and Interpolation Grid

All geographic operations, including transformation, cropping, Kriging, and comparing interpolations, are performed using general-purpose functions in the `R` package `sf` [@pebesma2018]. ThermoGlobe data and Similarity interpolations from @lucazeau2019 are transformed into a Pacific-centered Robinson coordinate reference system using the open source geographic transformation software `PROJ` [@proj2021]. The transformation is defined by the `proj4` string `"+proj=robin +lon_0=-155 +lon_wrap=-155 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs"`. The Kriging domains are defined by drawing 1000 $km$-radius buffers around each subduction zone segment defined by @syracuse2006. Target locations for Kriging (the interpolation grid) are defined across the same grid used by @lucazeau2019 to compute point-by-point differences with their Similarity interpolation (Figure \@ref(fig:domainConstruct)). In this case, grid point locations represent the centroids of 0.5$^\circ\ \times$ 0.5$^\circ$ unequal-area grid cells encompassing the entire globe.

(ref:domainConstructCap) Example of an interpolation domain constructed around the Sumatra Banda Sea segment. ThermoGlobe data [colored squares\; from @lucazeau2019] are cropped within a 1000 $km$-radius buffer (thin black line) surrounding the segment boundary (bold white line). Target locations for interpolation are defined by the intersections of a 0.5$^\circ\ \times$ 0.5$^\circ$ grid [fine black mesh\; defined by @lucazeau2019] cropped to the same buffer. Note that Sumatra Banda Sea is one of the more densely sampled regions, yet still has considerable observational gaps. Segment boundary and volcanoes (gold diamonds) defined by @syracuse2006. Plate boundaries (bold black lines) defined by @lawver2018.

### Kriging

Kriging is derived from the theory of *regionalized variables* [@matheron1963; @matheron2019] and estimates an unknown quantity as a linear combination of all nearby known quantities. Kriging is a three-step process that involves: 1) estimating an experimental variogram $\hat{\gamma}(h)$ that characterizes the spatial (dis)continuity of some quantity within the Kriging domain, 2) fitting one of many variogram models $\gamma(h)$ to the experimental variogram, and 3) directly solving a linear system of Kriging equations to predict unknown quantities at arbitrary target locations [@krige1951; @cressie2015]. The general-purpose functions defined in the `R` package `gstat` [@graler2016; @pebesma2004] are used to perform all three Kriging steps. The first step is computing an experimental variogram [after @bardossy1997]:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \hat{\gamma}(h) &= \frac{1}{2N(h)}\sum_{N(h)}^{}[Z(u_i) - Z(u_j)]^2 \\
    h &= |u_i - u_j| \\
  \end{aligned}
  (\#eq:variogram)
\end{equation}
where $Z(u_i)$ and $Z(u_j)$ are observations located at $u_i$ and $u_j$ separated by a lag of $h$, and $N(h)$ is the number of observations separated by a given lag distance. The experimental variogram $\hat{\gamma}(h)$ evaluates the spatial continuity of the set of observations $Z(u)$ by computing the average variance among pairs of observations separated by increasingly greater lag distances. By convention the average variance is halved and called "semivariance".

For regularly-spaced data, lag distances are simply multiples of the grid-step distance, but irregularly-spaced data must be treated differently. In the case of irregularly-spaced surface heat flow in this study, a binwidth $\delta$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    &\delta = \frac{\max(h)\ (n_{lag}+l)}{n_{lag}\ c} \\
    &N(h) = \#\{h \  \in \  [h - \delta,\  h + \delta)\}
  \end{aligned}
  (\#eq:binwidth)
\end{equation}
where $\max(h)$ is the maximum separation distance within the Kriging domain, $n_{lag}$ is the number of lags used to evaluate the variogram, $l$ is a lag shift constant that shifts the variogram by an integer number of binwidths, $c$ is a lag cutoff constant (by convention $c=3$). Then $N(h)$ is the number of observations that fall within $[h-\delta,\ h+\delta)$.

This study applies ordinary Kriging with isotropic variogram models (assumes semivariance is spatially invariant) to surface heat flow data projected onto a smooth sphere (neglects elevation). Kriging is applied locally (to avoid violating stationarity assumptions) by evaluating only the nearest $n_{max}$ observations at each target location, where "nearest" is defined by the distances between the target location and observations. Therefore, the domain of local Kriging expands or shrinks depending on the local observational density at each target location.

Several variogram parameters influence the Kriging result, including the choice of variogram model, the scope of local Kriging $n_{max}$, and choice of experimental variogram parameters in Equation \@ref(eq:variogram). Instead of choosing Kriging parameters by eye (a common practice for fitting variograms) this study uses a constrained non-linear optimization approach to find optimum values for the variogram parameters $\{model,\ n,\ c,\ n_{max},\ l\}$. A weighted sum of the \gls{rmse} evaluated during variogram fitting and the \gls{rmse} evaluated between Kriging estimates and surface heat flow observations is used as a cost function to simultaneously optimize variogram and Kriging accuracy [after @li2018]. The `R` package `nloptr` is used to optimize Kriging parameters by finding a combination of the parameters $\{model,\ n,\ c,\ n_{max},\ l\}$ that minimizes the cost function. A full description of the Kriging system of equations, underlying assumptions, and optimization methods is presented in Appendix \@ref(krigeOpt) with optimization results for all segments and variogram models. All experimental and fitted variograms are in Appendix \@ref(interpDiffAppendix) with interpolations for each case not presented in the main text.

### Upper-Plate Sector Profiles {#upSectors}

Surface heat flow profiles and distributions are computed for several adjacent upper-plate regions to assess lateral (along-strike) surface heat flow variability. Profiles are defined by (1) splitting a subduction zone segment [defined by @syracuse2006] into 2-14 equidistant parts, (2) defining 500 $km$-wide single-sided buffers (sectors) around the segment parts, and (3) calculating the orthogonal great circle distance between each surface heat flow prediction (Similarity and Kriging), or observation (ThermoGlobe data), contained within a sector and the segment boundary (trench). Steps (1-3) above closely approximate the projection of surface heat flow onto a 1D trench-orthogonal line at the center of each sector [e.g., @currie2004; @currie2006; @hyndman2005; @wada2009]. Profiles are smoothed by a three-point running average and fit with a local non-parametric regression curve [LOESS, @cleveland1988].

### Interpolation Accuracy

Previous studies evaluate global Similarity accuracy by either applying cross-validation during the interpolation process [e.g. @goutorbe2011] or directly computing residuals between predictions and surface heat flow observations after interpolation [e.g. @lucazeau2019]. Generally speaking, ranking models by comparing cross-validation results is typically preferred over directly comparing residuals for two reasons: (1) cross-validation gives a sense of how a model behaves when given *new* data (not part of the training data set used to fit the model), and (2) cross-validation can distinguish models that are overfit (high-accuracy due to "memorizing" the training data set). However, because Similarity is a non-parametric approach that does not involve "fitting" models to sets of training data (i.e. no residuals or cost function to minimize), cross-validating Similarity predictions does not effectively distinguish overfitting, nor does it give a sense of how well Similarity will behave when given new data. Similarity, as typically implemented [e.g. by @goutorbe2011; @lucazeau2019], always considers the entire global dataset of surface heat flow observations to make predictions at unknown target locations. Therefore leaving out a few observations has little effect. For example, even removing an entire continent's worth of surface heat flow data does not significantly affect the outcome of Similarity predictions compared to Similarity interpolations including the full ThermoGlobe dataset [see Figure 9 in @lucazeau2019].

In order to better compare Kriging (a parametric model fit to training data) and Similarity (a non-parametric model with prescribed weights), this study computes interpolation accuracies using a direct approach [similar to @lucazeau2019] for both methods. More specifically, the \gls{rmse} is computed for each surface heat flow observation by comparing the observed value to the nearest predicted value made across the 0.5$^\circ\ \times$ 0.5$^\circ$ interpolation grid. Compared to cross-validation, this direct method provides a more robust and effective comparison between Similarity and Kriging accuracies in this case. However, the direct approach is particularly susceptible to ignoring overfitting during Kriging estimation. Therefore caution must be taken to avoid misinterpreting unusually low Kriging error rates as indication of a more accurate model in all cases.

## Results {#chpt3Results}

### Similarity and Kriging Interpolations {#interpDiff}

#### Global Differences

Global differences between Similarity and Kriging interpolations across all subduction zone segments are centered near zero with median differences ranging from `r min(interp.diff$median)` to `r max(interp.diff$median)` $mWm^{-2}$, but broadly distributed with \glspl{iqr} from `r min(interp.diff$IQR)` to `r max(interp.diff$IQR)` $mWm^{-2}$ and long tails extending from `r min(interp.diff$min)` to `r max(interp.diff$max)` $mWm^{-2}$ (Table \@ref(tab:diffSummaryTable)). Distributions of interpolation differences are either approximately symmetrical, or slightly right-skewed (Figure \@ref(fig:diffSummaryPlot)). Slight right skew and positive median differences indicate a general tendency to predict higher surface heat flow by Similarity compared to Kriging. However, much of the right skew can be explained by spreading centers, transform faults, and volcanic regions predicted by Similarity that are unresolved by Kriging due to lack of observations in those regions (e.g. Scotia), and/or regions of anomalously-low surface heat flow within oceanic crust resolved by Kriging that are effectively overlooked by Similarity (e.g. Central America).

#### Regional Differences

Examples given in this section highlight the range of differences observed between Similarity and Kriging interpolations across subduction zone segments with anomalously-low surface heat flow within oceanic crust (Central America), with complex tectonic boundaries (Vanuatu), with excellent observational coverage (Kyushyu Ryukyu), and with very few observations (Scotia). Please refer to Appendix \@ref(interpDiffAppendix) for the remaining set of visualized interpolations.

##### Central America

Distance to plate boundaries and the age of oceanic lithosphere are key geologic proxies exerting strong influence on Similarity predictions [@shapiro2004; @stein1992; @goutorbe2011]. Consequently, Similarity predicts high surface heat flow along the arms of the Gal√°pagos triple junction and within the (young) converging Cocos Plate near Central America (Figure \@ref(fig:centralAmericaDiff)). Kriging, on the other hand, predicts relatively low surface heat flow within the Cocos Plate despite its young age and close proximity to the nearby spreading centers. This is explained by anomalously-low surface heat flow observed within the Cocos Plate that is interpreted as regional modification of the expected surface heat flow by hydrothermal circulation of seawater [@hutnak2008]. These widespread observations of low surface heat flow constrain Kriging predictions to similarly low values within the Cocos Plate. Moreover, disagreement between Similarity and Kriging appears more subdued within the upper-plate, yet Similarity still predicts slightly higher surface heat flow on average.

(ref:centralAmericaDiffCap) Similarity and Kriging interpolations for Central America. (a) Relatively high surface heat flow is predicted by Similarity within the young Cocos Plate (CP) and along the arms of the Gal√°pagos triple junction (GTJ): the East Pacific Rise (EPR) and Cocos Ridge (CR). In contrast, (b) many anomalously-low surface heat flow observations within the CP [@hutnak2008] constrain Kriging predictions to low values.

##### Vanuatu

The interpolation domain near Vanuatu is characterized by complex tectonic boundaries defining a number of microplates to the E of the volcanic arc (Figure \@ref(fig:vanuatuDiff)). The resolution of the geologic proxy datasets used to construct Similarity predictions (namely oceanic plate age, upper mantle density anomaly, sediment thickness, and distance to tectonic boundaries) is apparently too coarse to distinguish the small microplate to the N from the New Hebrides, Balmoral Reef, and Conway Reef microplates. According to Similarity, the entire region is comprised of young oceanic plate with thin sediment cover, and thus is predicted to have uniformly-high surface heat flow. In contrast, excellent observational coverage enables Kriging to clearly distinguish the northern microplate as an anomalously-low surface heat flow region compared to the other microplates. Outside of the cluster of microplates, Kriging presents an altogether smoother interpolation with lower predicted surface heat flow on average---similar to many other segments.

(ref:vanuatuDiffCap) Similarity and Kriging interpolations for Vanuatu. While (a) Similarity predicts more-or-less uniformly-high surface heat flow within the region defined by many microplates, (b) excellent observational coverage allows Kriging to distinguish the most northern microplate from the New Hebrides Plate (NHP), Balmoral Reef (BR), and Conway Reef  (CWR) microplates to the S. The geologic proxy datasets used to construct Similarity interpolations are apparently too coarse to resolve microplate-size features in this case.

##### Kyushu Ryukyu

The interpolation domain near the Kyushu Ryukyu segment is characterized by a complex juxtaposition of active subduction and volcanism on the margins of the Philippine Sea Plate, and active rifting between the Ryukyu arc and the Eurasian continent [the Okinawa trough, @minami2022]. Contrasting oceanic plate ages, topography/bathymetry, sediment thickness, volcanic activity, active tectonic settings (subduction vs. rifting) consequently produce a very textured distribution of Similarity predictions throughout the Kyushu Ryukyu domain (Figure \@ref(fig:kyushuRyukyuDiff)). For example, Similarity predictions clearly show the influence of multiple volcanic arc chains, plate boundaries, and the age of the subducting oceanic lithosphere. Geologic complexity notwithstanding, excellent coverage of surface heat flow observations throughout the domain enable Kriging predictions to resolve much of the texture predicted by Similarity. Regional Similarity and Kriging differences are small and narrowly distributed near Kyushu Ryukyu (median difference: `r interp.diff$median[interp.diff$segment == 'Kyushu Ryukyu']`, IQR: `r interp.diff$IQR[interp.diff$segment == 'Kyushu Ryukyu']` $mWm^{-2}$) compared to Central America (median difference: `r interp.diff$median[interp.diff$segment == 'Central America']`, IQR: `r interp.diff$IQR[interp.diff$segment == 'Central America']` $mWm^{-2}$; Table \@ref(tab:diffSummaryTable)) despite having a comparable number of observations (n = `r format(nrow(shp.hf.crop[['Kyushu Ryukyu']]), big.mark = ',')`) as Central America (n = `r format(nrow(shp.hf.crop[['Central America']]), big.mark = ',')`). While Kriging predictions are smoother overall, both interpolations appear to corroborate each other. This is especially true to the NE of the main Kyushu Ryukyu segment boundary.

(ref:kyushuRyukyuDiffCap) Similarity and Kriging interpolations for Kyushyu Ryukyu. (a) Similarity predicts a textured interpolation that is strongly influenced by multiple volcanic chains along the margins of the Philippine Sea Plate (PSP), contrasting oceanic plate ages, and active rifting in the Okinawa trough (OKT). (b) The Kriging interpolation is generally smoother, but corroborates much of the same texture predicted by Similarity due to relatively high observational density and regularity of observational coverage throughout the domain.

##### Scotia

The Scotia segment illustrates a case where surface heat flow observations are incredibly sparse. Yet Similarity predicts multiple tectonic features including the East Scotia Ridge and the WSW-ENE trending transform boundary separating the Scotia and Sandwich Plates from the Antarctic Plate (Figure \@ref(fig:scotiaDiff)). Combinations of geologic proxy datasets enable Similarity to resolve these features despite having very few observations within the interpolation domain. Kriging, on the other hand, shows a high heat flow anomaly more or less in the region of the East Scotia Ridge, and a few low heat flow anomalies on the Antarctic Plate, but does not resolve any structure in a way that is geologically useful. Few surface heat flow observations (n = `r nrow(shp.hf.crop[['Scotia']])`) result in smooth Kriging predictions that approximate the expected value (mean: `r hf.summary$mean[hf.summary$segment == 'Scotia']` $mWm^{-2}$) for most of the domain according to Equation \@ref(eq:linEstimate). 

(ref:scotiaDiffCap) Similarity and Kriging interpolations for Scotia. Despite incredibly sparse data (n = `r nrow(shp.hf.crop[['Scotia']])`), (a) Similarity identifies two tectonic features, the East Scotia Ridge (ESR) and a transform fault (TF) separating the Scotia and Sandwich Plates (SP, SAN) from the Antartic Plate (AP). (b) Kriging predicts a high heat flow anomaly in the region of the ESR, and a few low heat flow anomalies in the AP, but otherwise appears featureless due to sparse data.

#### Upper-Plate Sector Samples {#upSectorsResults}

Sampling the interpolation grid and ThermoGlobe data from adjacent upper-plate sectors allows for first-order quantitative evaluation of the along-strike variability in upper-plate surface heat flow. However, ThermoGlobe data within sectors are often too few ($n <$ 20 observations for `r nrow(sectors.df[sectors.df$n.obs < 20,])`/`r nrow(sectors.df)` sectors; Table \@ref(tab:sectorSummaryTable)) to compare distributions confidently with other sectors. Therefore, this study compares trench-orthogonal profiles of the dense, regularly-spaced Similarity and Kriging predictions. Generally speaking, distributions of Similarity and Kriging predictions in the upper-plates show a range of overlap and appear to fluctuate systematically across adjacent upper-plate sectors for some subduction zone segments. Moreover, Similarity and Kriging predictions reveal a variety of upper-plate surface heat flow profiles within, and among, subduction zone segments (Table \@ref(tab:sectorSummaryTable), Figures \@ref(fig:kyushuRyukyuUpper), \@ref(fig:sumatraBandaSeaUpper), \@ref(fig:newBritainSolomonUpper) & Appendix \@ref(lateralDiffAppendix)).

Below are three examples of subduction zone segments that illustrate part of the range of observed upper-plate surface heat flow patterns.

##### Kyushu Ryukyu

Kyushu Ryukyu characterizes a subduction zone segment with relatively consistent upper-plate surface heat flow for thousands of $km$ along-strike. In this case, *consistent* refers to comparable Similarity and Kriging predictions *and* consistent surface heat flow distributions across sectors. That is, medians and interquartile ranges of Similarity and Kriging predictions overlap relatively well across most sectors---differing by only `r sectors.summary$avg.med.dif[sectors.summary$segment == 'Kyushu Ryukyu']` $\pm$ `r 2*sectors.summary$sd.med.dif[sectors.summary$segment == 'Kyushu Ryukyu']` $mWm^{-2}$ on average (Table \@ref(tab:sectorSummaryTable) & Figure \@ref(fig:kyushuRyukyuUpper)). However, interquartile ranges of Kriging predictions are consistently larger than Similarity (differing by `r sectors.summary$avg.iqr.dif[sectors.summary$segment == 'Kyushu Ryukyu']` $\pm$ `r 2*sectors.summary$sd.iqr.dif[sectors.summary$segment == 'Kyushu Ryukyu']` $mWm^{-2}$ on average), implying a higher degree of variance than Similarity predictions. Notably, upper-plate surface heat flow appears to increase systematically from the NE to SW across sectors 8-6 before leveling out through sectors 5-1.

Meanwhile, ThermoGlobe data within Kyushu Ryukyu upper-plate sectors (n = `r sectors.summary$n.obs[sectors.summary$segment == 'Kyushu Ryukyu']`) vary considerably. Wide distributions of ThermoGlobe data appear near the trench and at approximately 200 $km$ from the trench, coinciding with the young active rifting in the Okinawa trough (Figure \@ref(fig:kyushuRyukyuUpper)). Yet, smoothed trench-orthogonal Similarity and Kriging profiles gently arc through the approximate midrange of ThermoGlobe data. Profile shapes are consistent across sectors and show relatively little spread ($\leq$ 25 $mWm^{-2}$). All profiles gradually rise from approximately 50 $mWm^{-2}$ at the trench to maximums of approximately 75-100 $mWm^{-2}$ before gradually decreasing to approximately 75 $mWm^{-2}$ at 500 $km$ into the upper-plate.

##### Sumatra Banda Sea

Sumatra Banda Sea characterizes a subduction zone segment with moderately consistent upper-plate surface heat flow for thousands of $km$ along-strike. In this case, *moderately consistent* refers to mostly comparable (overlaping) Similarity and Kriging predictions that distinctively fluctuate in a similar manner across sectors. That is, medians and interquartile ranges of Similarity and Kriging predictions overlap well for some sectors, but not others (e.g. sectors 1, 10, & 11, Figure \@ref(fig:sumatraBandaSeaUpper)). Median Similarity and Kriging predictions differ by `r sectors.summary$avg.med.dif[sectors.summary$segment == 'Sumatra Banda Sea']` $\pm$ `r 2*sectors.summary$sd.med.dif[sectors.summary$segment == 'Sumatra Banda Sea']` $mWm^{-2}$ on average, and interquartile ranges differ by `r sectors.summary$avg.iqr.dif[sectors.summary$segment == 'Sumatra Banda Sea']` $\pm$ `r 2*sectors.summary$sd.iqr.dif[sectors.summary$segment == 'Sumatra Banda Sea']` $mWm^{-2}$ on average across all sectors (Table \@ref(tab:sectorSummaryTable)). Notably, Similarity and Kriging predictions appear to broadly oscillate between higher and lower surface heat flow across adjacent sectors with a wavelength on the order of several sectors (10$^3$ $km$).

Meanwhile, Similarity and Kriging profiles show obvious differences. For example, Similarity predictions are distributed narrowly and increase monotonically from the trench to 500 $km$ into the upper-plate, whereas Kriging profiles generally ramp up more steeply and begin to disperse at approximately 200 $km$ from the trench. Similarity profiles remain narrowly distributed through at least 300 $km$ from the trench, whereas Kriging profiles show up to 25-30 $mWm^{-2}$ spread among sectors at 300-500 $km$ from the trench.

(ref:sumatraBandaSeaUpperCap) Surface heat flow profiles for Sumatra Banda Sea upper-plate sectors. (a) Similarity and Kriging predictions across sectors are moderately distinguishable with mostly overlapping interquartile ranges, except for sectors 1, 10, & 11 (boxes). (b) Profiles are computed by finding orthogonal distances between the segment boundary (trench; bold black line) and `r sectors.summary$n.sim[sectors.summary$segment == 'Sumatra Banda Sea']` surface heat flow predictions within ten 500 $km$-wide sectors (colored polygons). Profiles (colored curves with 95% confidence intervals) of (c) Kriging predictions show greater overall spread than (d) Similarity profiles (e.g. $\geq$ 200 $km$ from the trench), implying non-uniform upper-plate surface heat flow across the segment. Colored squares are ThermoGlobe data from @lucazeau2019. Segment boundary and volcanoes (gold diamonds) defined by @syracuse2006. Plate boundaries (bold black lines) defined by @lawver2018.

##### New Britain Solomon

New Britain Solomon characterizes a subduction zone segment with inconsistent upper-plate surface heat flow and poor overlap between Similarity and Kriging predictions. Only one sector (sector 8) shows overlapping interquartile ranges of Similarity and Kriging predictions, whereas all other sectors strongly diverge (Figure \@ref(fig:newBritainSolomonUpper)). For example, median Kriging predictions range by `r sectors.summary$range.med.krg[sectors.summary$segment == 'New Britain Solomon']` $mWm^{-2}$ across all sectors, whereas median Similarity predictions range by `r sectors.summary$range.med.sim[sectors.summary$segment == 'New Britain Solomon']` $mWm^{-2}$. Moreover, Similarity and Kriging medians across all sectors differ by `r sectors.summary$avg.med.dif[sectors.summary$segment == 'New Britain Solomon']` $\pm$ `r 2*sectors.summary$sd.med.dif[sectors.summary$segment == 'New Britain Solomon']` $mWm^{-2}$ on average. Notably, opposing wave-like oscillations between higher and lower surface heat flow across adjacent sectors are observed in Similarity and Kriging predictions.

Meanwhile, Similarity and Kriging profiles are obviously distinguishable. For example, Kriging profiles are smooth and closely parallel ThermoGlobe data, whereas Similarity profiles show higher average surface heat flow (Figure \@ref(fig:newBritainSolomonUpper)). In contrast to flat Kriging profiles, high surface heat flow regions along Similarity profiles clearly show the influence of certain tectonic features (e.g. in sector 4, which intersects a volcanic center and ridge segment). Moreover, small confidence intervals around Kriging profiles suggest small uncertainties compared to Similarity. However, Kriging is determined to find the smallest variance solution by definition and can easily overfit the small number (n = `r sectors.summary$n.obs[sectors.summary$segment == 'New Britain Solomon']`) of ThermoGlobe data. Divergence between Similarity and Kriging predictions near New Britain Solomon thus appear to be driven by methodological differences and a tendency for Kriging to overfit small sample sets.

(ref:newBritainSolomonUpperCap) Surface heat flow profiles for New Britain Solomon upper-plate sectors. (a) Similarity and Kriging predictions across sectors are very distinguishable with non-overlapping interquartile ranges (boxes). (b) Profiles are computed by finding orthogonal distances between the segment boundary (trench; bold black line) and `r sectors.summary$n.sim[sectors.summary$segment == 'New Britain Solomon']` surface heat flow predictions within five 500 $km$-wide sectors (colored polygons).

Colored squares are ThermoGlobe data from @lucazeau2019. Segment boundary and volcanoes (gold diamonds) defined by @syracuse2006. Plate boundaries (bold black lines) defined by @lawver2018.

### Optimum Kriging Parameters

Optimized Kriging parameters vary substantially from segment to segment (Table \@ref(tab:vgrmSummaryTable)). However, despite a range of domain sizes, observational densities, and diverse plate configurations, Kriging parameters converge on solutions for all Kriging domains (Figure \@ref(fig:optTrace)) and show no systematic correlation with cost, with the exception of a negative correlation with the logarithm of the variogram model sill (Figure \@ref(fig:vgrmSummaryPlot)). Differences in cost are apparently explained by systematic regional differences in surface heat flow distributions (i.e. differences in the constant terms $\sigma_{vgrm}$ and $\sigma_{interp}$ in Equation \@ref(eq:costExp)) rather than sensitivity to any particular Kriging parameter.

### Similarity and Kriging Error Rates

Regional Kriging error rates (ranging from `r round(min(v.opt$rmse.krige), 1)` to `r round(max(v.opt$rmse.krige), 1)` $mWm^{-2}$) are very similar to Similarity error rates from the same regions (ranging from `r round(min(v.opt$rmse.sim), 1)` to `r round(max(v.opt$rmse.sim), 1)` $mWm^{-2}$, Table \@ref(tab:vgrmSummaryTable)). Kriging errors can be relatively small compared to Similarity for domains with high observational density (e.g. `r v.opt$segment[which.min(v.opt$rmse.krige[!(v.opt$segment %in% c('Scotia'))])]`; n = `r format(nrow(shp.hf.crop[[v.opt$segment[which.min(v.opt$rmse.krige[!(v.opt$segment %in% c('Scotia'))])]]]), big.mark = ',')`, $\Delta$RMSE$_{K-S}$ = `r round(v.opt$rmse.krige[which.min(v.opt$rmse.krige)] - rmse.luca$rmse[which.min(v.opt$rmse.krige)], 1)`) but relatively large where observational density is comparatively low (`r v.opt$segment[which.max(v.opt$rmse.krige)]`; n = `r format(nrow(shp.hf.crop[[v.opt$segment[which.max(v.opt$rmse.krige)]]]), big.mark = ',')`, $\Delta$RMSE$_{K-S}$ = `r round(v.opt$rmse.krige[which.max(v.opt$rmse.krige)] - rmse.luca$rmse[which.max(v.opt$rmse.krige)], 1)`). Note the small Kriging error rate computed for `r v.opt$segment[which.min(v.opt$rmse.krige)]` (`r v.opt$rmse.krige[which.min(v.opt$rmse.krige)]` $mWm^{-2}$), which likely reflects overfitting of few (n = `r format(nrow(shp.hf.crop[[v.opt$segment[which.min(v.opt$rmse.krige)]]]), big.mark = ',')`) observations. On average, Kriging error rates are `r round(mean(v.opt$rmse.krige/rmse.luca$rmse), 1)` times Similarity error rates across all segments. In comparison to previous work, regional Similarity error rates for most subduction zone segments in Table \@ref(tab:vgrmSummaryTable) are much higher than the 7 $mWm^{-2}$ Similarity error rate reported by @lucazeau2019. However, Similarity error rates in Table \@ref(tab:vgrmSummaryTable) are consistent with global Similarity error rates computed by cross-validation on a 1$^\circ \times$ 1$^\circ$ (from 11.6 to 29.0 $mW/m^{-2}$) reported previously by @goutorbe2011.

## Discussion {#chpt3Discussion}

### Comparing Similarity and Kriging Interpolations {#interpDiffDiscussion}

If the goal is understanding subduction zone thermal structure and geodynamics, comparing two independent interpolation methods has distinct advantages. For example, this study finds many cases of Similarity and Kriging predictions corroborating known, expected, or predicted tectonic features. These include: (1) broad regions of low surface heat flow defining the oceanic plate and forearc along the Kamchatka Marianas segment (Figure \@ref(fig:kamchatkaMarianasDiff)), (2) high surface heat flow anomalies defining the volcanic center and transform fault separating the South American Plate and Caribbean Plates near the Lesser Antilles Segment (Figure \@ref(fig:lesserAntillesDiff)), (3) the general seafloor thermal structure near the N Philippines segment (Figure \@ref(fig:nPhilippinesDiff)), (4) a broad region of high surface heat flow within the NW part of the Sumatra Banda Sea segment upper-plate (Figure \@ref(fig:sumatraBandaSeaDiff)), and (5) high surface heat flow defining volcanic arc chains near the Kyushu Ryukyu segment (Figure \@ref(fig:kyushuRyukyuDiff)).

While corroboration of known or expected features is an advantageous outcome when comparing independent interpolation methods, finding inconsistencies between Similarity and Kriging predictions is at least as valuable. For example, this study finds many cases of Similarity and Kriging predictions identifying unexpected or poorly resolved tectonic features. These include: (1) much of the thermal structure along the Andes segment (Figure \@ref(fig:andesDiff)), (2) the location and extent of two spreading centers, the tip of a transform fault, and the regional thermal structure of the Cocos Plate near the Central America segment (Figure \@ref(fig:centralAmericaDiff)), (3) locations of plate boundaries near the New Britain Solomon (Figure \@ref(fig:newBritainSolomonDiff)) and Scotia segments (Figure \@ref(fig:scotiaDiff)), (4) a large low surface heat flow anomaly near the Sumatra Banda Sea segment (east of Borneo at approximately 120$^\circ$E and 5$^\circ$S, Figure \@ref(fig:sumatraBandaSeaDiff)), (5) a high heat flow anomaly defining a transform fault near the N tip of the Tonga New Zealand segment (Figure \@ref(fig:tongaNewZealandDiff)), and (6) the location of microplate boundaries near the Vanuatu segment (Figure \@ref(fig:vanuatuDiff)). 

By definition, such inconsistencies between Similarity and Kriging interpolations identify tectonic features that either violate geologic proxy datasets, violate local surface heat flow observations, lack sufficient observational coverage to be resolved by Kriging, or are too fine-scale to be resolved by geologic proxy datasets on a 0.5$^\circ\ \times$ 0.5$^\circ$ grid. In any case, the above examples demonstrate the utility of comparing independent interpolation methods in identifying relevant targets for future investigation and data acquisition (discussed more below). Maps of regional interpolated surface heat flow prepared in this study (Section \@ref(chpt3Results) and Appendices \@ref(interpDiffAppendix) & \@ref(lateralDiffAppendix), or similar) therefore provide important context for subduction zone research.

### Comparing Upper-Plate Sectors

#### Issues with Irregularly-Spaced Data

Surface heat flow profiles in previous studies are computed with observations sampled from within a single sector [@currie2004; @currie2006; @hyndman2005; @furukawa1993; @wada2009; @kerswell2020]. While extending a single-sector sampling approach to many adjacent sectors is simple to implement, inherent pitfalls are immediately obvious when comparing ThermoGlobe data among sectors. For example, the spatial density and regularity of ThermoGlobe data within adjacent sectors can often be drastically different (e.g. compare ThermoGlobe data counts across sectors from Central America, Sumatra Banda Sea, and Tonga New Zealand in Table \@ref(tab:sectorSummaryTable)). Fluctuating sample sizes among upper-plate sectors can make statistical comparisons of ThermoGlobe data equivocal.

Indeed, this study finds comparing ThermoGlobe data among upper-plate sectors problematic. For instance, ThermoGlobe data are often too few (n < 20 observations for `r nrow(sectors.df[sectors.df$n.obs < 20,])`/`r nrow(sectors.df)` sectors, Table \@ref(tab:sectorSummaryTable)) to compare with statistical confidence. Many sectors (n = `r nrow(sectors.df[sectors.df$n.obs == 1,])`) have a single observation with a singular distribution (\gls{iqr} = 0) or few observations spanning a large range (very large \gls{iqr}). Many sectors encompass zero ThermoGlobe data and therefore cannot be compared at all. In other words, summary statistics necessary for gauging the (dis)continuity of surface heat flow among sectors (e.g. median, \gls{iqr}, Table \@ref(tab:sectorSummaryTable)) can be generally considered unreliable for up to `r nrow(sectors.df[sectors.df$n.obs < 20,])`/`r nrow(sectors.df)` sectors.

The above limitation arising from sampling irregularly-spaced data can be easily overcome by interpolation. That is because sampling a regular interpolation grid allows for more consistent sample sizes and spatial coverage across sectors. For example, many sectors defined in this study have few ThermoGlobe data (n < 5 observations for `r nrow(sectors.df[sectors.df$n.obs < 5,])`/`r nrow(sectors.df)` sectors, Table \@ref(tab:sectorSummaryTable)), yet the average number of interpolation targets within those same sectors is `r round(mean(sectors.df$n.sim[sectors.df$n.obs < 5]))`---about `r round(mean(sectors.df$n.sim[sectors.df$n.obs < 5])/5)` times the sample size on average. Surface heat flow variability among sectors is thus more confidently and consistently evaluated with interpolations *derived from* ThermoGlobe data, rather than from ThermoGlobe data directly.

#### (Dis)continuity of Upper-Plate Surface Heat Flow

Despite being derived from nearly-identical sets of processed ThermoGlobe data, comparisons of Similarity and Kriging predictions across thousands of square kilometers of upper-plate sectors very clearly show mixed results. In summary, Similarity and Kriging predictions from `r nrow(sectors.df)` upper-plate sectors neither show broadly continuous nor broadly discontinuous upper-plate surface heat flow within, or among subduction zone segments. Rather than observing consistency and uniformity in upper-plate surface heat flow, a Kaleidoscope of surface heat flow profiles and distributions are observed (compare Figures \@ref(fig:kyushuRyukyuUpper), \@ref(fig:sumatraBandaSeaUpper), \@ref(fig:newBritainSolomonUpper), and see Appendix \@ref(lateralDiffAppendix) & Table \@ref(tab:sectorSummaryTable)).

How consistent and continuous is upper-plate surface heat flow within, and among subduction zone segments? The Kaleidoscope of surface heat flow profiles and distributions observed across all 13 subduction zone segments is somewhat ambiguous in this regard. While Similarity and Kriging predictions show discontinuous upper-plate surface heat flow patterns for some segments (e.g. Andes, Lesser Antilles and Vanuatu, Figures \@ref(fig:andesUpper), \@ref(fig:lesserAntillesUpper) & \@ref(fig:vanuatuUpper)), other segments show rather continuous patterns (e.g. Central America, Kamchatka Marianas, Kyushu Ryukyu, N Philippines, Figures \@ref(fig:centralAmericaUpper), \@ref(fig:kamchatkaMarianasUpper), \@ref(fig:kyushuRyukyuUpper), \@ref(fig:nPhilippinesUpper)), and still other segments show mixed patterns depending on the interpolation method (e.g. Alaska Aleutians, New Britain Solomon, S Philippines, Sumatra Banda Sea, Tonga New Zealand, Figures \@ref(fig:alaskaAleutiansUpper), \@ref(fig:newBritainSolomonUpper), \@ref(fig:sPhilippinesUpper), \@ref(fig:sumatraBandaSeaUpper), \@ref(fig:tongaNewZealandUpper)).

On one hand, Similarity and Kriging interpolations can show nearly-identical profiles continuing along-strike for 1000's of $km$ (e.g. Kamchatka Marianas, Kyushu Ryukyu, Sumatra Banda Sea, Figures \@ref(fig:kamchatkaMarianasUpper), \@ref(fig:kyushuRyukyuUpper), \@ref(fig:sumatraBandaSeaUpper)). These segments demonstrates the possibility of large-scale continuity in upper-plate surface heat flow and may imply spatially homogeneous lithospheric thermal structure and/or spatially homogeneous heat-transferring dynamics inferred from previous work [e.g. Chapter \@ref(chpt2)\; @currie2004; @currie2006; @furukawa1993; @wada2009; @kerswell2020]. However, an alternative explanation is that continuous surface heat flow is a consequence of undersampling relative to the local spatial variability of surface heat flow. Moreover, most segments show neither completely continuous nor discontinuous upper-plate surface heat flow patterns (Table \@ref(tab:sectorSummaryTable)).

Another type of continuous pattern observed across some segments is an apparent wave-like oscillation between higher and lower surface heat flow across multiple adjacent upper-plate sectors. The most notable case is the Sumatra Banda Sea segment (Figure \@ref(fig:sumatraBandaSeaUpper)), where median Similarity and Kriging predictions oscillate with a wavelength on the order of 10$^3$ $km$ (approximately 5-7 sectors). Such large-wavelength oscillations may imply gradual along-strike variation in upper-plate thickness, coupling depths, and/or lithosphere-asthenosphere geodynamics. Note that near surface perturbations probably do not significantly factor into large-scale oscillations because hydrothermal effects are expected to be locally distributed in accordance with thin sediment cover (< 400 $m$) and/or close proximity to seamounts [< 60 $km$, @hasterok2011].

#### Identifying Survey Targets

Ideal survey targets for future surface heat flow observations will simultaneously improve the spatial resolution and/or accuracy of Similarity and Kriging methods. For Similarity, this means ensuring that the geographic configurations of new survey targets (the geologic context) have the greatest diversity possible and do not overlap significantly with already oversampled regions in the geologic proxy parameter space. For example, enormous amounts of surface heat flow observations are located near young spreading centers because of historically productive study sites like Cascadia off the western coast of North America. This has the effect of biasing Similarity predictions to look like Cascadia---as all unknown interpolation targets located near young spreading centers will automatically adopt the same distribution of surface heat flow values measured near the western coast of North America (Figure \@ref(fig:cascadiaBias)). The same principle applies to any other geologic proxy variable that has been heavily sampled from a particular region because of historical efforts. With respect to Similarity, oversampling within the geologic proxy parameter space is dually undesirable because it adds elements of bias and spatial-dependence to a method that is otherwise advantageous because of its spatial-independence.

(ref:cascadiaBiasCap) Global distribution of surface heat flow observations and distances to young rifts. (a) Surface heat flow data appear to be sampled from a diverse range of distances from young rifts compared to (b) the global potential. However, (c) normalized density estimates reveal regions of over- and under-sampling within the geologic proxy parameter space. Moreover, oversampling at distances within a few tens of kilometers from young rifts correspond to thousands of observations collected from very few regions, including Cascadia off the W coast of North America, potentially biasing Similarity predictions to look like those areas. Global proxy data from @goutorbe2011.

```{r cascadiaBias, fig.cap='(ref:cascadiaBiasCap)', fig.scap='Surface heat flow profiles for New Britain Solomon upper-plate sectors'}

knitr::include_graphics('assets/figs/chpt3/cascadiaBias.png')

```

For Kriging, ideal survey target sites will provide the most regular coverage over a region of spatial interest (e.g. a particular subduction zone segment). Evaluating surface heat flow distributions across upper-plate sectors offers opportunities for discovering future survey targets by identifying the least-constrained sectors. For example, segments with the greatest Similarity-Kriging discrepancies among sectors tend to have: (1) very few ThermoGlobe data (e.g. Alaska Aleutians, N Philippines, New Britain Solomon, S Philippines), (2) highly-irregular spatial coverage of ThermoGlobe data (e.g. Andes, Central America, Lesser Antilles), and/or (3) complex upper-plate tectonics (Vanuatu). A simple query of the ThermoGlobe dataset by sector can identify individual sectors with low and/or highly-irregular observational density and/or large Similarity-Kriging discrepancies. Thus, current observational gaps in regional surface heat flow can be efficiently identified by comparing independent interpolation methods within multiple-sectors.

### Comparing Similarity and Kriging Accuracies

Neither Similarity nor Kriging methods are evidently more favorable for every interpolation domain on first principles. Nor do the error rates in Table \@ref(tab:vgrmSummaryTable) indicate a clear accuracy advantage of one method over the other with respect to predicting regional (10$^2$ to 10$^3$ $km$) distributions of surface heat flow near subduction zone segments. It appears that either method is successfully generalizable and appropriate for subduction zone research.

While some segments do show a large discrepancy between Similarity and Kriging error rates (e.g. Scotia), it is important to note that low error rates do not necessarily imply more accurate predictions. For Scotia, few observations naturally lead to overfitting and low error rates during Kriging. But it is also practically possible to reduce Kriging error rates by choosing different Kriging parameters and/or highly localizing Kriging---thereby (un)intentionally overfitting ThermoGlobe data and artificially increasing accuracy. In such cases, overfitting compromises regional interpolation accuracy. At `r round(mean(v.opt$rmse.krige/rmse.luca$rmse), 1)` times greater error rates than Similarity on average, however, Kriging error rates do not suggest overfitting is a prevalent issue in this study (Tables \@ref(tab:vgrmSummaryTable) and \@ref(tab:vgrmSummaryTableLong)).

Differences in error rates notwithstanding, Similarity has a distinct advantage compared to Kriging when applied to regions with relatively low observational density and/or highly-irregular spatial coverage. For example, Similarity predictions appear to be remarkably consistent with known tectonic features even in cases with few observations (e.g. Scotia and New Britain Solomon, Figures \@ref(fig:scotiaDiff) & \@ref(fig:newBritainSolomonDiff)). Integrating geologic proxies is therefore preferred when limited observations preclude practically useful Kriging interpolations.

### Layered Interpolation Approach

Similarity and Kriging interpolations are distinguishable by eye at the regional scale when compared side-by-side (e.g. compare Figures \@ref(fig:centralAmericaDiff), \@ref(fig:kyushuRyukyuDiff), and \@ref(fig:scotiaDiff) with the remaining segments in Appendices \@ref(interpDiffAppendix) & \@ref(lateralDiffAppendix)). The same unique properties of Similarity and Kriging methods that make them quickly discernible by eye can be independently leveraged. For example, because Similarity is inherently agnostic to the spatial configuration of observations [@goutorbe2011], accurate interpolations with well-defined plate boundaries are still possible for regions with relatively few observations (e.g. Scotia and New Britain Solomon, Figures \@ref(fig:scotiaDiff) & \@ref(fig:newBritainSolomonDiff)). Since surface heat flow observations near subduction zone segments are commonly sparse and irregularly spaced, spatial-independence from observations is a desirable property to maintain during the interpolation process.

On the other hand, conserving the "ground-truth" is equally desirable property to maintain during the interpolation process. Local ordinary Kriging conserves ground-truth by remaining agnostic to all other factors but the spatial configuration of surface heat flow observations (see Appendix \@ref(krigeOpt)). For example, Kriging resolves tectonic features near Tonga New Zealand and Vanuatu that are discordant with Similarity predictions, yet compatible with ThermoGlobe data (Figures \@ref(fig:tongaNewZealandDiff) & \@ref(fig:vanuatuDiff)). Another example is the young Cocos Plate near Central America where Similarity predicts relatively high heat flow by proximity to two spreading centers and young oceanic plate age, yet observations of anomalously low surface heat flow [e.g. @hutnak2008] constrain Kriging predictions to low values. Such contrasting predictions imply ThermoGlobe data violate one or more geologic proxy data sets used by Similarity. In other words, Kriging will tend to highlight anomalies (compared to Similarity) if they exist and have been observed.

In principle, carefully layering Similarity and Kriging methods may combine their properties to produce more accurate regional interpolations. A layered approach simultaneously respects the First [@krige1951] and Third Laws of Geography [@zhu2018] by integrating geologic and spatial information. Any number of methods may be applied to combine Similarity and Kriging predictions. As a basic example: (1) compare Similarity and Kriging layers to detect anomalies, (2) compute weights proportional to the squared difference between Similarity and Kriging predictions to emphasized (or subdue) anomalies, (3) combine Similarity and Kriging layers using a weighted average scheme. Similar methods may be the topic of future research.

## Conclusions

This study evaluates regional patterns of surface heat flow near subduction zones by comparing Similarity and Kriging interpolations across adjacent upper-plate sectors. Methodological differences between Similarity and Kriging yield a Kaleidoscope of upper-plate surface heat flow distributions and profiles among subduction zone segments. Such mixed results highlight at least three important points of consideration regarding regional surface heat flow near active subduction zones:

1. Accurate regional interpolations of irregularly-spaced ThermoGlobe data are key to understanding broad (segment-scale) variations in lithospheric thermal structure near subduction zones 
2. Mixed upper-plate surface heat flow distributions and profiles imply various degrees of regional (dis)continuity exist among subduction zones in terms of their lithospheric thermal structure (contrary to expectations from Chapter \@ref(chpt2)), heat-transferring subsurface dynamics, and/or observational density relative to the local spatial variability of (unknown) surface heat flow
3. Future surface heat flow surveys should maximize the potential for increasing Similarity and Kriging accuracies by carefully considering the existing distributions of observation across (actual) space and within geologic proxy parameter space
3. Layered interpolation approaches may produce more accurate surface heat flow predictions by combining the independently-advantageous properties of Similarity and Kriging methods

# Computing Rates and Distributions of Rock Recovery in Subduction Zones {#chpt4}

\markboth{Chapter 4: Marker Recovery}{Chapter 4: Marker Recovery}

## Abstract {#chpt4Abstract}

\Glsfirst{hp} metamorphic rocks that are detached (recovered) from subducting oceanic-plates and exhumed to the Earth's surface become invaluable records of \gls{pt}-strain fields deep in subduction zones. For example, \glsfirst{ptt} estimates from suites of \gls{hp} rocks can partially reconstruct thermal gradients along the plate interface through time, and in turn, reveal important thermo-kinematic constraints on the evolution of oceanic lithosphere during subduction. However, incompatible interpretations concerning thermal gradients, recovery rates, and recovery depths arise when directly comparing globally aggregated \gls{ptt} estimates from \gls{hp} rocks (the *rock record*) with numerical simulations of subduction. The crux of such disagreements stems from comparisons with a relatively small rock record that make assertions statistically weak. As an alternative approach, this study implements a soft clustering classification algorithm to identify marker recovery in numerical simulations of subduction. Over one-million markers are traced and classified from 64 simulations representing the range of presently active subduction zones on Earth. Marker \gls{ptt} distributions are compared across models and with the rock record to address the following questions: how do recovery rates vary among subduction zones? How is recovery distributed along the plate interface, and how does it vary among subduction zones and through time? Marker \gls{ptt} distributions, recovery rates, and relative recovery timing show clear (non)correlations with certain thermo-kinematic boundary conditions. Likewise, recovered markers show a range of compatibility with the rock record depending on the compiled dataset and suite(s) of numerical experiments. Most importantly, recovered markers indicate a range of (in)plausible thermo-kinematic conditions for reproducing the rock record and highlight the immediate usefulness of augmenting observational constraints with a large (n = `r format(nrow(marx.class.summary[marx.class.summary$recovered,]), big.mark = ',')`) simulated petrological dataset.

## Introduction {#chpt4Intro}

Maximum metamorphic conditions, in terms of \glsfirst{pt}, have been estimated for hundreds of \glsfirst{hp} rocks exhumed from subduction zones [Figure \@ref(fig:rockPTComp), @agard2018; @penniston2015]. Aggregated suites of \gls{hp} rocks (the *rock record*) are the only tangible record of \gls{pt}-strain fields experienced by Earth's lithosphere during deformation and chemical processing in subduction zones [e.g., @agard2009; @agard2018; @penniston2015]. Together with geophysical imaging [e.g., @ferris2003; @naif2015; @hyndman2003; @syracuse2006; @rondenay2008], surface heat flow [e.g. Chapter \@ref(chpt3)\; @currie2006; @gao2014; @wada2009; @hyndman2005], and forward numerical modelling [e.g., @gerya2008; @gerya2002; @sizova2010; @gerya2006; @syracuse2010; @yamato2007; @yamato2008; @hacker2003; @peacock1990; @peacock1996; @mckenzie1969], the rock record underpins contemporary understandings of subduction geodynamics [e.g., @agard2009; @agard2018; @bebout2007].

(ref:rockPTCompCap) \gls{pt} estimates from the rock record. (a) Maximum metamorphic conditions for exhumed \gls{hp} rocks compiled by @penniston2015 (solid colored contours; n = `r nrow(pd15)`) and @agard2018 (filled colored contours; n = `r nrow(ag18)`) roughly fall within thermal gradients from 5 $K/km$ to 20 $K/km$ (thin black lines; calculated with a lithostatic gradient of 35 $km/GPa$). Note that pd15 includes many (U)\gls{hp} continental samples with P estimates in excess of 3 GPa, whereas ag18 contains samples derived only from oceanic lithologies. The \gls{cdf} curves in (b) and (c) show the relative abundance of rocks recovered across PT space. Note the shared axes with (a). While pd15 and ag18 show nearly identical T distributions, their P distributions are offset by inclusion of HT/LP metamorphic soles (HT white data points) and exclusion of (U)\gls{hp} continental rocks by ag18. Regardless, pd15 and ag18 imply 80-95% of subducted rocks are recovered from $\leq$ 2.5 GPa. Note that unlike `ag18`, `pd15` includes eclogites exhumed from extreme pressures (above approximately 3 $GPa$) that generally have felsic compositions and typify deep subduction of continental material exhumed immediately preceding continental collision [@agard2018].

include_graphics('assets/figs/chpt4/rox_comp.png')

```

However, it remains difficult to interpret global compilations of \gls{pt} estimates in terms of rates and distributions of rock recovery in subduction zones. For example, global \gls{pt} estimates compiled by @penniston2015 and @agard2018 (the `pd15` and `ag18` datasets) reveal a kinked \glsfirst{cdf} with respect to pressure (Figure \@ref(fig:rockPTComp)b). A change in \gls{cdf} slope around `r round(tail(ag18.P$P[ag18.P$prob <= 0.9], 1), 1)`-`r round(tail(pd15.P$P[pd15.P$prob <= 0.8], 1), 1)` $GPa$ implies relatively uniform recovery of oceanic material up to `r round(tail(ag18.P$P[ag18.P$prob <= 0.9], 1), 1)`-`r round(tail(pd15.P$P[pd15.P$prob <= 0.8], 1), 1)` $GPa$, but increasingly rare recovery above `r round(tail(ag18.P$P[ag18.P$prob <= 0.9], 1), 1)`-`r round(tail(pd15.P$P[pd15.P$prob <= 0.8], 1), 1)` $GPa$ [@agard2018; @kerswell2020]. Notably, evidence of uniform mechanical coupling depths among presently active subduction zones near 2.3 $GPa$ [Chapter \@ref(chpt2)\; @currie2006; @furukawa1993; @wada2009; @kerswell2020] is consistent with maximum recovery depths implied by `pd15` and `ag18`. Yet constraints on coupling depth limits are still being revised [@abers2020] and upper-plate surface heat flow patterns presented in Chapter \@ref(chpt3) are generally inconsistent with uniform coupling depths. Moreover, it is unclear to what extent `ag18` and `pd15` represent sampling bias (i.e. fewer ultra-\gls{hp} rocks are studied than lower-grade rocks). Nevertheless, important observations regarding rock recovery in subduction zones follow from `pd15` and `ag18`:

> 1. The probability of rock recovery from $\leq$ 2.5 $GPa$ is relatively uniform
>
> 2. Between `r round(pd15.P$prob[which.min(abs(pd15.P$P-2.5))]*100)`-`r round(ag18.P$prob[which.min(abs(ag18.P$P-2.5))]*100)`% of recovered rocks equilibrate at pressures $\leq$ 2.5 $GPa$
>
> 3. Between `r round(ag18.grad$prob[which.min(abs(ag18.grad$grad-10))]*100)`-`r round(pd15.grad$prob[which.min(abs(pd15.grad$grad-10))]*100)`% of recovered rocks record thermal gradients of $\leq$ 10 $C/km$ and `r round(ag18.grad$prob[which.min(abs(ag18.grad$grad-15))]*100)`-`r round(pd15.grad$prob[which.min(abs(pd15.grad$grad-15))]*100)`% record thermal gradients of $\leq$ 15 $C/km$

These observations raise important questions in subduction zone research: are rocks recovered broadly and uniformly along the plate interface or discretely from certain depths? How do recovery rates and \gls{pt} distributions change across diverse subduction zone systems? Previous work comparing the rock record directly with numerical models has generally produced ambiguous interpretations concerning rates and distributions of rock recovery. For example, comparisons of different geodynamic codes with diverse subsets of the rock record show various extents of agreement in terms of overlapping \gls{pt} distributions and thermal gradients [@penniston2015; @yamato2007; @yamato2008; @roda2010; @angiboust2012b; @roda2012; @burov2014; @ruh2015; @plunder2018; @roda2020; @holt2021]. Initial conditions for numerical experiments [oceanic-plate age, convergence velocity, subduction dip angle, upper-plate thickness, and heating sources, @kohn2018; @ruh2015; @penniston2015; @vankeken2019], differential recovery rates from subduction zones with favorable thermo-kinematic boundary conditions [@abers2017; @vankeken2018], and comparisons among suites of undifferentiated \gls{hp} rocks [e.g. grouping rocks recovered immediately following subduction initiation with rocks recovered during "steady-state" subduction, see @agard2018] are all potential explanations for (non)overlapping \gls{pt} estimates and thermal gradients. Such assorted sensitivities warrant further investigation into the general response of \gls{pt} distributions to broad ranges of thermo-kinematic boundary conditions.

The primary obstacle in confidently interpreting rates and distributions of recovery from the rock record fundamentally stems from relatively small sample sizes (typically less than a few dozen \gls{pt} estimates from any given exhumed terrane). This Chapter addresses the problem by augmenting observational constraints with a large (n = `r format(nrow(marx.class.summary[marx.class.summary$recovered,]), big.mark = ',')`) simulated \gls{ptt} dataset. The assumption is that such a large dataset is insensitive to outliers and represents a statistically robust picture of recovery rates and \gls{pt} distributions in presently active subduction zones. Clear correlations among recovery rates, \gls{pt} distributions, and thermo-kinematic boundary conditions are found---indicating a range of (in)plausible conditions for reproducing the rock record.

## Methods {#chpt4Methods}

This study presents a dataset of Lagrangian markers (described below) from the numerical experiments in Chapter \@ref(chpt2) [@kerswell2020]. The experiments simulate 64 oceanic-continental convergent margins with thermo-kinematic boundary conditions (oceanic-plate age, convergence velocity, and upper-plate lithospheric thickness) that generally represent the range of presently active subduction zones [@syracuse2006; @wada2009]. Initial conditions were modified from previous studies of active margins [@sizova2010; @gorczyk2007]. The code `I2VIS` models visco-plastic flow of geologic materials by solving three conservative equations of mass, energy, and momentum on a fully-staggered finite difference grid with a *marker-in-cell* technique [@gerya2003; @harlow1965]. Further details about the initial setup, boundary conditions, and rheologic model are in Chapter \@ref(chpt2) and Appendix \@ref(deHydration) [@kerswell2020]. Details about the marker-in-cell technique are in @gerya2003 and @gerya2019.

This section defines Lagrangian markers (now referred to as markers) and briefly elaborates on their usefulness in understanding fluid flow, followed by a description of the marker classification algorithm. Mathematical details on classification are in Appendix \@ref(gmm).

### Lagrangian Markers

Markers are mathematical objects representing discrete parcels of fluid flowing in a continuum [@harlow1962; @harlow1964]. Tracing markers (saving marker information at each timestep) is distinctly advantageous for investigating subduction dynamics in the following two ways.

First, under a set of assumptions, tracing markers is like tracing a rock's \gls{ptt} history. Assumptions in this study include an incompressible continuum [@batchelor1953; @boussinesq1897], a petrologic model governing marker material properties [@ito1971; @schmidt1998], and a highly non-linear rheologic model relating stress and strain by empirical flow laws [@hilairet2007; @ranalli1995; @karato1993; @turcotte2002]. Insofar as Earth's lithosphere behave like an incompressible visco-plastic fluid [under the assumptions above, @gerya2019; @kerswell2020; @gerya2003], comparisons between marker \gls{ptt} paths and the rock record may be made.

Second, markers deform in a partly layered, partly heterogeneous, high-strain region known as the *plate interface*, *subduction interface*, or *subduction channel* [@gerya2002]. Current conceptual models of the plate interface epitomize a visco-plastic continuum with complex geometry and structure, sharp thermal, chemical, and strain gradients, strong advection, and abundant fluid flow [@agard2016; @agard2018; @bebout2002; @bebout2007; @gerya2003; @syracuse2010; @penniston2015]. Because finite-difference numerical approaches do not perform well with strong local gradients, interpolating and updating temperature, strain, and chemical fields with markers greatly improves accuracy and stability of numerical solutions [@gerya2003; @gerya2019; @moresi2003].

### Marker Classification

On average, `r format(round(mean(stats.summary$n.est)), big.mark = ',')` markers are initially selected from within a 760 $km$ wide and 8 $km$ deep section of oceanic crust and seafloor sediments at $t$ = 0 $Ma$. Tracing proceeds for 115 timesteps, which is sufficient for most markers to be deeply subducted ($\geq$ 200 $km$) from their initial positions. However, only markers recovered from the subducting oceanic-plate are relevant for comparison with \gls{pt} estimates of natural rocks. The main challenge, therefore, is to first determine which markers among `r format(nrow(marx.class.summary), big.mark = ',')` detach and move away from the subducting plate without knowing their fate *a priori*.

Classifying markers as either *recovered* or *lost* based solely on their undifferentiated traced histories defines an unsupervised classification problem [@barlow1989]. This study implements a Gaussian mixture model [Appendix \@ref(gmm), @reynolds2009], which is a type of "soft" clustering algorithm used extensively to solve such problems. In this case, Gaussian mixture model organizes markers into groups (clusters) by fitting $k=10$ bivariate Gaussian distributions to their maximum \gls{pt} (attained at depths of at least 20 $km$; maximum P and T are considered independently). "Fitting" refers to adjusting parameters of all $k$ Gaussians (centroids and covariance matrices) until the Gaussian ellipsoids and data achieve maximum likelihood (see Appendix \@ref(gmm)). Groups of markers are then labeled as either *recovered* or *lost* based on cluster centroid locations in \gls{pt} space and other simple rules given in Table \@ref(tab:rules).

(ref:classCap) Example of marker classification for model cdf78. Clustering assigns `r format(round(stats.summary$n.est[stats.summary$model == 'cdf78']), big.mark = ',')` markers (squares) into ten classes according to their maximum \gls{pt} relative to all other markers (left). The size of cluster centroids (triangles) are proportional to the number of markers in a class. Markers belonging to clusters with centroids that have average \gls{pt} gradients greater than 5 $K/km$ (plotting to the right of the thin black line labelled "5") classify as recovered. Additional rules are applied to (re)classify individual markers (right; see Table \@ref(tab:rules)). Thin black lines are average \gls{pt} gradients of 5 $K/km$ and 20 $K/km$ (calculated with a lithostatic gradient of 35 $km/GPa$).

```{r class, fig.cap='(ref:classCap)', fig.scap='Example of marker classification for model cdf78'}

include_graphics('assets/figs/chpt4/cda78_k10_class.png')

```

Please note that classification is possible by directly applying simple rules without clustering [e.g. markers reach a max depth of $Z$ before returning to a depth of $Z-dZ$, @roda2010]. This is an example of "hard" classification that assigns binary labels (marker is either recovered or lost), which is generally less flexible than "soft" approaches like Gaussian mixture model that assign probabilities (maker is 85% likely recovered, 15% likely lost). Similar approaches using Gaussian mixture model are broadly used in many scientific fields for pattern recognition, anomaly detection, and estimating complex probability distribution functions [e.g., @banfield1993; @celeux1995; @figueiredo2002; @fraley2002; @vermeesch2018]. Moreover, clustering methods (Appendix \@ref(gmm)) may be generally adopted to distinguish many possible feature(s) in geodynamic numerical models with Lagrangian reference frames. Figure \@ref(fig:class) shows an example of marker classification for 1 of 64 numerical experiments. All other experiments are in Appendix \@ref(vis).

## Results {#chpt4Results}

### PT Distributions of Recovered Markers

Markers compiled from all numerical experiments show distinct patterns of probability density and absolute \gls{pt} compared to `pd15` (Figure \@ref(fig:meta)). Marker density is asymmetric and bimodal with a high-probability peak around 1 $GPa$ (lower-blueschist to upper-greenschist facies) and a modest probability hill aroung 2.5 $GPa$ (upper-blueschist to eclogite facies). The probability density distribution of `pd15`, in contrast, is slightly shifted towards higher \gls{pt} gradients overall and is more uniformly distributed along a high-probability ridgeline spanning from 0.8 to 2.4 $GPa$ (upper-greenschist to lower-eclogite facies). \gls{hp} rocks recovered from 0.8 $GPa$ to 2.4 $GPa$ are especially overrepresented in `pd15` compared to markers compiled from all numerical experiments (Figure \@ref(fig:meta)).

(ref:metaCap) \gls{pt} distribution of recovered markers from all simulations. Maximum \gls{pt} for `r format(nrow(marx.class.summary[marx.class.summary$rec,]), big.mark = ',')` recovered markers compiled from all 64 subduction zone simulations (left; colored contours) show an asymmetric, bimodal distribution with a high-probability peak around 1 $GPa$ (upper-greenschist to lower-blueschist facies) and a modest probability hill around 2.5 $GPa$ (upper-blueschist to eclogite facies). Recovered markers neither completely overlap with the rock record (`pd15`; light gray density contours) in absolute \gls{pt} nor in terms of probability density. The \gls{cdf} (right) shows markers recovered between approximately 0.8 and 2.4 $GPa$ (greenschists to upper-blueschist) are especially overrepresented in the rock record (`pd15`; gray line) compared to simulations (black line). Rocks with maximum pressures above 2.4 $GPa$ (eclogites) are also overrepresented in the rock record (to a lesser degree) compared to simulations. Note that the gap between the gray and black lines (right) represents the relative difference in abundance of recovered material between `pd15` and simulations. Thin black lines are average \gls{pt} gradients of 5 $K/km$ and 20 $K/km$ (calculated with a lithostatic gradient of 35 $km/GPa$).

To better understand how rock recovery varies among subduction zones, marker \gls{pt} distributions are visualized in terms of convergence velocity (Figure \@ref(fig:cvDensity)), oceanic-plate age (Figure \@ref(fig:ageDensity)), upper-plate lithospheric thickness (Figure \@ref(fig:zupDensity)), and relative detachment timing (Figure \@ref(fig:detachDensity)).

#### Convergence Velocity Effect

Convergence velocity exhibits the strongest effect on marker \gls{pt} distributions. Markers recovered from the slowest-converging simulations (40 $km/Ma$) are more uniformly distributed across a wide band of metamorphic facies from approximately 0.8 to 3 $GPa$ (lower-greenschist to eclogite facies) compared to faster-converging simulations (Figure \@ref(fig:cvDensity)). The broadly skewed probability ridgeline exhibited by the slowest-converging models is most similar to `pd15`'s broad bimodal probability ridgeline in the sense that markers are recovered with relative frequency across a broad range of pressures. These \gls{pt} distributions contrast with faster-converging simulations that have more discrete, segregated, high-probability regions with a stronger majority components of \gls{hp} markers recovered around 1 $GPa$ (upper-greenschist to blueschist facies). Simulations with convergence velocities $\geq$ 66 $km/Ma$ also appear to have significant gaps in recovery between approximately 1.5 to 2.5 $GPa$ (blueschist and eclogite facies) and higher average \gls{pt} gradients. Please note, however, that simulations with $\geq$ 66 $km/Ma$ convergence rates are most similar with `pd15` if only comparing absolute \gls{pt} distributions.

(ref:cvDensityCap) \gls{pt} distribution of recovered markers by convergence velocity (panel headers = $km/Ma$). Marker \gls{pt} distributions (colored contours) are remarkably different for the lowest-convergence simulations (topleft; 40 $km/Ma$) compared to all other convergence rates ($\geq$ 66 $km/Ma$). The slowest-converging simulations recover fewer markers (distribution is smoother) along lower average \gls{pt} gradients, and have more uniform probability density across pressures $\geq$ 2 $GPa$. Faster-converging simulations ($\geq$ 66 $km/Ma$) show more segregated distributions with significant gaps in recovery around 2 $GPa$ (blueschist facies). The rock record (`pd15`; light gray contours) is most consistent with slow convergence ($<$ 66 $km/Ma$) in terms of probability density but more consistent with the faster convergence ($\geq$ 66 $km/Ma$) in terms of absolute \gls{pt}. An apparent threshold and geodynamic shift exists between velocities of 40 to 66 $km/Ma$. Thin black lines are average \gls{pt} gradients of 5 $K/km$ and 20 $K/km$ (calculated with a lithostatic gradient of 35 $km/GPa$).

include_graphics('assets/figs/chpt4/cv_cdf.png')

```

#### Oceanic-plate Age Effect

Oceanic-plate age has the second strongest effect on marker \gls{pt} distributions, although the effect is relatively small compared to convergence velocity. Older oceanic-plates recover fewer markers from slightly higher average pressures than younger oceanic-plates (Figure \@ref(fig:ageDensity)). Significant gaps in the abundances of moderate-P and (ultra-)\gls{hp} rocks appear in simulations across oceanic-plate ages, except for simulations with 85 $Ma$ plates. Oceanic-plates $\geq$ 85 $Ma$ are most consistent with `pd15`, but still very distinct.

(ref:ageDensityCap) \gls{pt} distribution of recovered markers by oceanic-plate age (panel headers = $Ma$). Marker \gls{pt} distributions (colored contours) show a trend towards lower recovery rates (smoother contours), a shift towards higher average pressures, and more uniform probability density across 1.5 to 2.5 $GPa$ (lower-blueschist to lower-eclogite facies) with increasing oceanic-plate age. The rock record (`pd15`; light gray contours) generally agrees more with older oceanic-plates ($\geq$ 85 $Ma$), yet is still distinct. Thin black lines are average \gls{pt} gradients of 5 $K/km$ and 20 $K/km$ (calculated with a lithostatic gradient of 35 $km/GPa$).

```{r ageDensity, fig.cap='(ref:ageDensityCap)', fig.scap='\\gls{pt} distribution of recovered markers by oceanic-plate age'}

include_graphics('assets/figs/chpt4/age_cdf.png')

```

#### Upper-plate Thickness Effect

Chapter \@ref(chpt2) demonstrates an association between upper-plate thickness and coupling depth in the same numerical experiments that markers are sampled from [@kerswell2020]. \gls{pt} distributions of markers are therefore expected to respond strongly to changes in upper-plate thickness, especially with respect to pressure (depth). However, a surprisingly modest effect is observed (Figure \@ref(fig:zupDensity)). Marker density transitions towards more uniform distributions and higher top-end pressures with increasing upper-plate thickness, while average \gls{pt} gradients significantly decrease. The shift towards more abundant (ultra-)\gls{hp} rocks with increasing upper-plate thickness is more modest than anticipated from Chapter \@ref(chpt2) but still consistent with a general increase in mechanical coupling depth with increasing upper-plate thickness [@kerswell2020; @ruh2015].

Notably, markers recovered from simulations with thin upper-plates ($\leq$ 62 $km$) match `pd15` well in terms of *absolute* \gls{pt} distribution. Yet, marker densities draw the opposite association (thicker upper-plates are most consistent with `pd15`). A noticeable absence of markers recovered from pressures of approximately 2 $GPa$ in simulations with thin upper-plates is also inconsistent with `pd15`, which has a modest-probability hill around 2 $GPa$ where relatively few markers get recovered.

(ref:zupDensityCap) \gls{pt} distribution of recovered markers by upper-plate lithospheric thickness (panel headers = $km$). Marker \gls{pt} distributions (colored contours) become marginally more uniform and have lower average \gls{pt} gradients with increasing upper-plate thickness. The rock record (`pd15`; light gray contours) is most consistent with thin upper-plates ($\leq$ 62 $km$) in terms of absolute \gls{pt} distribution. Regardless of upper-plate thickness, relatively few markers are recovered from pressures around 2 $GPa$ compared to the rock record. In general, upper-plate thickness has a surprisingly small effect on the \gls{pt} distribution of recovered markers with respect to pressure. Thin black lines are average \gls{pt} gradients of 5 $K/km$ and 20 $K/km$ (calculated with a lithostatic gradient of 35 $km/GPa$).

```

#### Detachment Timing Effect

Figure \@ref(fig:detachDensity) shows marker \gls{pt} distributions at 10 percent increments of total subduction duration. Marker recovery exhibits three trends with respect to time. First, marker recovery rates decrease through time with a substantial drop after approximately 40% of total subduction duration. Second, average \gls{pt} gradients rotate anti-clockwise from approximately 10-15 to 5 $K/km$ after 50% of total subduction duration. Finally, markers are recovered from increasingly higher pressures beginning from 0.2-1.3 to 3.5 $GPa$ by 40% of total subduction duration. Secular trends in marker recovery show significant low-P, moderate- to high-T marker recovery (greenschist to amphibolite facies) during the first 30-40% of the subduction life-cycle, followed by a higher relative proportion of (ultra-)\gls{hp} markers (blueschist and eclogites). Absolute \gls{pt} trends are most consistent with `pd15` during the first third of the subduction life-cycle, but marker probability density is most consistent with `pd15` during the final half of the subduction life-cycle.

### Recovery Rates

A notable pattern emerges when comparing recovery rates among all 64 subduction simulations by thermo-kinematic boundary conditions (Figure \@ref(fig:recRate)). Simulations with younger and more slowly converging oceanic-plates (low-$\Phi$) have higher recovery rates than older and more quickly converging oceanic-plates (high-$\Phi$). This negative correlation between $\Phi$ and recovery rate appears gradual and continuous. In contrast, no apparent correlation exists between recovery rate and upper-plate lithospheric thickness. Please also note that low-$\Phi$ simulations generally appear to have broader distributions of marker recovery across pressure in addition to higher recovery rates (Figure \@ref(fig:recRate)).

On average `r round(mean(stats.summary$est.ratio)*100, 1)` percent of markers get recovered from subduction (Table \@ref(tab:recSummary)). While volumes of rock cannot be directly computed from recovery rates because markers are mathematical point features, volumes may be roughly estimated by assuming markers represent the entire 760 $\times$ 8 $km$ section of oceanic crust and seafloor sediments they were sampled from. Rates of subducted material then range from `r format(round(min((1-stats.summary$est.ratio)*760*8)), big.mark = ',')` to `r format(round(max((1-stats.summary$est.ratio)*760*8)), big.mark = ',')` $km^3/km$, with a mean of `r format(round(mean((1-stats.summary$est.ratio)*760*8)), big.mark = ',')` $km^3/km$. Rates of recovered material range from `r format(round(min(stats.summary$est.ratio*760*8)), big.mark = ',')` to `r format(round(max(stats.summary$est.ratio*760*8)), big.mark = ',')` $km^3/km$, with a mean of `r format(round(mean(stats.summary$est.ratio*760*8)), big.mark = ',')` $km^3/km$.


(ref:recRateCap) Recovery rates for all 64 subduction simulations by thermo-kinematic boundary conditions. Negative correlations are observed among recovery rate, oceanic-plate age ($Ma$), convergence velocity ($km/Ma$), and thermal parameter ($\Phi$; $km/100$). Note that $\Phi$ is simply the product of oceanic-plate age and convergence velocity. No apparent correlation is observed between recovery rate and upper-plate thickness ($km$). Data point size and color represent the interquartile range of maximum marker pressures ($GPa$). The youngest and slowest-moving oceanic-plates generally have the highest recovery rates and marker recovery across broader ranges of pressures.

## Discussion {#chpt4Discussion}

### Recovery Rates

Marker recovery rates show a smooth negative correlation with $\Phi$ and no correlation with upper-plate thickness (Figure \@ref(fig:recRate)). Geodynamic factors contributing to this association are difficult to deduce, however, partly because $\Phi$ itself was formulated from a general relationship among thermo-kinematic boundary conditions to explain differences in earthquake distributions among subduction zones [@molnar1979; @kirby1991; @gorbatov1997; @mckenzie1969], and likely never intended as a precise tool for investigating subduction geodynamics. Notwithstanding, oceanic-plate age appears to explain most of the correlation between recovery rates and $\Phi$. Average recovery rate drops systematically with increasing oceanic-plate age. In contrast, only the slowest-converging simulations (40 $km/Ma$) appear to have distinct recovery rates compared to more quickly-converging simulations ($\geq$ 66 $km/Ma$, Figure \@ref(fig:recRate)). 

A common observation among simulations with young oceanic-plates, especially at slow convergence rates, are high subduction angles. Moreover, simulations with high subduction angles tend to create more space for underplating detached material (see Figure \@ref(fig:geodyn), discussed below). These observations imply recovery rates respond to $\Phi$ because of differences in plate flexibility and overall subduction geometry, rather than oceanic-plate age and convergence velocity *per se*. Please note, however, that subduction angle appears to be most strongly correlated with subduction duration compared to other thermo-kinematic boundary conditions [@hu2020]. Drawing a relationship among $\Phi$, subduction angle, and recovery rates, without also considering subduction duration, is therefore inconclusive. Recovery rates may obviously correlate with $\Phi$, but a concrete explanation is difficult to untangle.

### PT Distributions

Although \gls{pt} distributions of recovered markers for some simulations are consistent with `pd15` in absolute terms, probability densities bear little resemblance to `pd15` for most simulations. From an absolute perspective, marker \gls{pt} distributions from simulations with moderate to fast convergence velocities ($\geq$ 66 $km/Ma$, Figure \@ref(fig:cvDensity)), older oceanic-plates ($\geq$ 85 $Ma$, Figure \@ref(fig:ageDensity)), or thin upper-plates ($\leq$ 62 $km$, Figure \@ref(fig:zupDensity)) could be considered consistent with `pd15`. However, it would be very unlikely to reproduce `pd15` by randomly sampling markers from the above simulations. Only the slowest-converging simulations recover \gls{hp} rocks with similar relative frequency across pressures of $\sim$ 0.8 to 2.4 $GPa$ compared to `pd15` (Figure \@ref(fig:ecdfs)).


The fact that very few simulations recover as many markers from 0.8 to 2.4 $GPa$ compared to `pd15`, except for the slowest-converging systems (Figure \@ref(fig:ecdfs)), is a key result of this study. Different possible interpretations may follow from this observation. For example, the rock record may be comprised of \gls{hp} rocks mostly recovered from slowly-converging subduction zones. Alternatively, the rock record may not reflect the true distribution of \gls{hp} rocks recovered in subduction zones and is overrepresented (biased) by \gls{hp} rocks between 0.8 to 2.4 $GPa$. A simple calculation may test the former interpretation:

> One-half of modern day subduction zone segments have estimated convergence velocities below 66 $km/Ma$ [@syracuse2010]. As a conservative estimate, the prior probability of sampling a \gls{hp} rock from a slowly-converging system is around 50%, assuming the proportion of slowly-converging systems is constant through time and recovery rates are equal among subduction zones. So the chance of sampling a \gls{hp} rock from a slowly-converging system is not exceedingly small. However, the probability that half (n = `r format(nrow(pd15[pd15$P >= 0.8 & pd15$P <= 2.4,])/2, big.mark = ',')`) of \gls{hp} rocks in `pd15` with pressure estimates between 0.8 and 2.4 $GPa$ (n = `r format(nrow(pd15[pd15$P >= 0.8 & pd15$P <= 2.4,]), big.mark = ',')`) were sampled from slowly-converging systems can be approximated by a binomial probability distribution:
> \begin{equation}P(k) = B\left(n \atop k \right)\ p^k\ q^{n-k} = B\left(260 \atop 130 \right)\ 0.5^{130}\ 0.5^{130} \approx 5\% (\#eq:binom) \end{equation}
> where $P(k)$ is the probability of sampling $k=130$ \gls{hp} rocks from $n=260$ trials, $B\left( n \atop k \right) = n!/k!(n-k)!$ is the binomial distribution, and $p$ and $q$ are the chances of sampling a \gls{hp} frock from a slowly-converging system and not sampling a \gls{hp} rock, respectively.

In other words, there is a 5% chance that 130/260 \gls{hp} rocks in `pd15` were sampled exclusively from slowly-converging ($\leq$ 66 $km/Ma$) subduction zones. It is therefore unlikely that `pd15` represents preferential sampling of \gls{hp} rocks from only slowly-converging subduction zones (the same principle can also be applied to other thermo-kinematic boundary conditions). Rather, it is much more likely that `pd15` reflects an overabundance of undifferentiated samples between 0.8 and 2.4 $GPa$. While the true distribution of \gls{hp} rock recovered globally cannot be known, rough calculations demonstrating the improbability of preferential sampling from a subset of subduction zones and a general inconsistency among marker \gls{pt} distributions and the rock record stress the importance of differentiating \gls{pt} estimates with relevant metadata. For example, sorting aggregated suites of \gls{hp} rocks by like metamorphic ages, lithologies, and estimates for thermo-kinematic boundary conditions [e.g., @agard2018], make for better comparisons with natural and simulated \gls{ptt} datasets.

### Geodynamic regimes {#geodynamics}

Marker motions are constrained by a high-viscosity wedge of upper mantle in the forearc region (known as the *cold nose*) and a low-viscosity serpentinized subduction channel (see Appendix \@ref(vis)). Four geodynamic regimes are observed across all 64 simulations, each with a different channel geometry and pressure distribution of recovered markers (Figure \@ref(fig:geodyn)). Thick, rigid oceanic-plates, especially converging at high velocities (high-$\Phi$), tend to have low subduction angles and narrow subduction channels. Most markers are recovered at the base of the accretionary prism and no eclogites are recovered. These simulations imply systems with low subduction angles are expected to have low recovery rates from pressures $\geq$ 1.5 $GPa$ (Figure \@ref(fig:geodyn), cdh94).

The other three geodynamic regimes share two commonalities: 1) they recover eclogites to various degrees, and 2) they have more flexible oceanic-plates and higher subduction angles. Slowly-converging systems with flexible plates (low-$\Phi$) tend to have wider subduction channels that accommodate more underplating of oceanic crust and sediments along the length of the subduction interface compared to flatter subduction angles (Figure \@ref(fig:geodyn), cde62). Markers from simulations with higher subduction angles display more uniform \glspl{cdf}, with respect to pressure, that closely resemble `pd15` (compare insets in Figure \@ref(fig:geodyn)). These observations again imply rock recovery is sensitive to the geometry of subduction, which may be conflated with other thermo-kinematic boundary conditions when using $\Phi$ as an explanatory variable.

The last two geodynamic regimes are characterized by narrow channels that widen at depth, separating the cold nose from the upper-plate (Figure \@ref(fig:geodyn) cdb78, cda78). In many simulations, the mantle wedge separates entirely and the low-viscosity serpentine channel connects with the lower continental crust. A subvertical, low-viscosity corridor forms and markers rise as diapirs into the mantle wedge (Figure \@ref(fig:geodyn), cda78). Moreover, markers \glspl{cdf} from simulations with diapirs closely resemble `pd15` (compare insets in Figure \@ref(fig:geodyn)). These simulations imply mantle wedge separation may be a plausible mechanism for diapir formation.

## Conclusion {#chpt4Conclusions}

This study traces \gls{ptt} paths of more than one-million markers from 64 subduction simulations, identifies recovered markers, and computes their \gls{pt} distributions across a range of thermo-kinematic boundary conditions. \gls{ptt} distributions of recovered markers are compared with the rock record (`pd15`) to address the following hypotheses:

> 1. The probability of recovering \gls{hp} rocks is relatively uniform up to `r round(tail(pd15.P$P[pd15.P$prob <= 0.8], 1), 1)` $GPa$ (null: recovery is non-uniform with depth)
>
> 2. Recovery rates of \gls{hp} rocks vary with thermo-kinematic boundary conditions (null: recovery rates are not different among subduction zone)

With respect to the first hypothesis, \gls{pt} distributions of recovered markers are distinct from the rock record (`pd15`) across almost all simulations except for a minority of slowly-converging models (40 $km/Ma$, Figure \@ref(fig:ecdfs)), and models that develop separated mantle wedges and diapirs (Figure \@ref(fig:geodyn)). The majority of simulations recovery relatively few markers from 0.8 to 2.4 $GPa$ compared to `pd15`. This result implies `pd15` is overrepresented (biased) by \gls{hp} rocks between 0.8 and 2.4 $GPa$. Differentiating the rock record by relevant metadata (lithology, metamorphic ages, thermo-kinematic boundary conditions estimates) is critically important to select against such bias [e.g., @agard2018].

With respect to the second hypothesis, recovered markers show a negative correlation between $\Phi$ and recovery rate, implying a strong dependence of recovery rates on thermo-kinematic boundary conditions. However, simulations also show an apparent association between recovery rates and subduction angle. This may imply that recovery rates are sensitive to $\Phi$ because of differences in subduction geometry, rather than oceanic-plate age or convergence velocity *per se*. Correlations among recovery rate and thermo-kinematic boundary conditions are difficult to untangle because $\Phi$ conflates thermo-kinematic effects (by design) and is therefore not the most precise explanatory variable. While a correlation between recovery rates and $\Phi$ is apparent, the sensitivity of recovery rates to thermo-kinematic boundary conditions (Figure \@ref(fig:recRate)), especially subduction geometry, warrants further investigation.

# Conclusion {#chpt5}

\markboth{Chapter 5: Conclusion}{Chapter 5: Conclusion}

This work uses three computational approaches---simulation, interpolation, and applied statistics---to address the following question. How diverse is mechanical behavior along the plate interface across a range of plausible subduction zone configurations?

Plate coupling observed in numerical simulations from Chapter \@ref(chpt2) demonstrate steady-state mechanical behavior regulated self-consistently by feedbacks involving heat transfer and metamorphic dehydration of ultramafic sheet silicates in the upper-plate mantle. Coupling depth is only weakly correlated with $\Phi$ but strongly correlated with upper-plate lithospheric thickness. Thus uniform coupling depths are expected if subduction zones have uniformly thick upper-plates, which is indeed the case when considering averaged backarc surface heat flow for 17 presently active subduction zones [@currie2004; @hyndman2005; @currie2006; @wada2009].

However, 2D interpolations in Chapter \@ref(chpt3) show diverse spatial patterns of surface heat flow---some implying homogeneous thermal structure, others implying heterogeneous thermal structure---near 13 presently active subduction zones. While Kriging methods yield inconsistent results for segments with low observational densities, the Similarity method shows geologically-consistent interpolations of surface heat flow across all segments. Both methods, where applicable, generally agree and present surface heat flow interpolations in contradiction of broadly uniform upper-plate lithospheric thickness inferred from other (1D) sampling strategies [e.g., @currie2004; @hyndman2005; @currie2006; @wada2009]. These results imply broadly non-uniform coupling depths among subduction zones.

Chapter \@ref(chpt4) takes a different approach by considering what \gls{pt} distributions of \gls{hp} rocks imply about mechanical variability among subduction zones. A large (`r format(nrow(marx.class.summary[marx.class.summary$rec,]), big.mark = ',')`) dataset of recovered markers shows marker \gls{ptt} distributions and recovery rates correlate with $\Phi$ and subduction duration, but not upper-plate lithospheric thickness (as expected from Chapter \@ref(chpt2)). These results imply broad differences in the mechanics of rock recovery through time and among subduction zones.

While self-regulating mechanisms of uniform (and sustained) depths of plate coupling among different subduction zones are plausible (Chapter \@ref(chpt2)), 2D interpolations of surface heat flow (Chapter \@ref(chpt3)), and \gls{ptt} distributions of recovered markers (Chapter \@ref(chpt4)) imply a more diverse picture of mechanical behavior across different subduction zone settings. One reason for such assorted conclusions is using a relatively crude explanatory variable ($\Phi$) for comparison. $\Phi$ is demonstrably useful for explaining variability among some features of subduction geodynamics [@molnar1979; @kirby1991; @gorbatov1997; @wada2009; @syracuse2010], but demonstrably ineffective in many cases [@maunder2019]. Future work may focus on developing new explanatory variables, scaling surface heat flow datasets, and developing composite interpolation approaches to better estimate relative geodynamic variability among subduction zones.

# Effects of Thermo-kinematic Boundary Conditions on Plate Coupling in Subduction Zones

### Serpentine Stability Depth Through Time {#antDepth}

Stability of serpentine progressively increases with depth along the plate interface as the subducting oceanic-plate continuously cools and hydrates the shallow upper-plate mantle. However, this phenomenon ceases after approximately 5 $Ma$ and dynamics change. From approximately 5 $Ma$ to tens of $Ma$ afterwards, the lower limit of serpentine dehydration stabilizes (Figure \@ref(fig:antDepth)). In theory, serpentine dehydration should continue to increase as long as water continues to flux from the oceanic-plate and the shallow upper-plate remains stagnant and cooling. Stability of serpentine dehydration through tens of $Ma$ is direct result of the correspondence between mechanical coupling and absence of serpentine along the plate interface. Notably, using Lagrangian frameworks to implement metamorphic reactions is an advantageous numerical feature allowing for such behavior.

```{r antDepth, fig.cap='Serpentine stability depth at the plate interface vs. time for models cda, cdf, and cdp with $Z_{UP}$ = 46, 62, 78, and 94 $km$. Serpentine stabilization deepens for approximately 5 $Ma$ of subduction and then remains roughly constant for $\\leq$ 10 $Ma$. The exceptions are models with very thin $Z_{UP}$, which exhibit transient behavior for at least 15 $Ma$. Overall serpentine stability depth after approximately 5 $Ma$ depends on upper-plate thickness.', fig.scap='Serpentine stability depth vs. time'}

```

Numerical experiments in this chapter suggest a negative dynamic feedback regulating coupling and serpentine dehydration can help explain how similar configurations, in terms of depths to subducting plates beneath arcs [@england2004] and thin upper-plates [@currie2006], may occur in subduction zones with different thermo-kinematic boundary conditions and subduction durations. The results indicate that subduction zones quickly ($<$ 5 $Ma$) develop and stabilize quasi-permanent, generalized configurations with coupling depth dependent on upper-plate thickness.

Notable exceptions occur in models with the thinnest upper-plates ($Z_{UP}$ = 46 $km$). Rapid extension due to thin upper-plates form spreading centers in the upper-plate within 5 $Ma$. Passive asthenospheric upwelling near spreading centers diverts heat from deep within the upper-plate mantle. Enough heat is apparently diverted to disrupt thermal feedbacks regulating coupling and serpentine stability near the plate interface. In principle, diversion of heat from the plate interface could lead to cooler conditions, deeper serpentine stability, and thus deeper coupling. Further testing to confirm this behavior may artificially increase upper-plate strength in thin upper-plate thickness experiments to prevent high rates of spreading.

### Regression Summaries {#regSummary}

The form of the preferred quadratic regression model in Section \@ref(cdEstimators) (Figure \@ref(fig:results) & Table \@ref(tab:zcResults)) implies a lower limit to coupling depth of approximately 60 $km$, even for thin upper-plate thickness and, presumably, under warm conditions during nascent subduction. In principle, thin upper-plates could allow effective heat transfer in a flowing shallow asthenospheric mantle---hindering deep stabilization of serpentine. Olivine and pyroxene would be the stable mantle minerals, and strong, shallow coupling between plates would be expected @gerya2008. However, even the warmest numerical experiments (low-$\Phi$ & thin upper-plate thickness) in Chapter \@ref(chpt2) eventually stabilize serpentine in the shallow upper-plate mantle. This is evident by increasing depth of mechanical coupling with time for the first 5 $Ma$ of subduction (Figure \@ref(fig:antDepth)).

Model names are listed along the top axis and correspond to the range of thermal parameter $\\Phi$ values along the bottom axis.

### (De)hydration Model {#deHydration}

The material properties used in the numerical experiments are listed in Table \@ref(tab:materials) and Table \@ref(tab:melts). For details about the sedimentation and erosion, melting and extraction, and rheological models, please refer to @sizova2010. Here we discuss only the hydrodynamic model, because it is the most relevant aspect of the numerical experiments.

Hydrodynamics in the numerical models control the timing and magnitude of mantle wedge hydration. The main sources of water delivered to the mantle are altered basaltic crust and seafloor sediments, which we assumed to contain up to 5 $wt.\% H_{2}O$. We assumed a gradual expulsion of water from pore space and through quasi-continuous dehydration reactions occurring within the slab. Water content is computed using the following equation:
\begin{equation}
  \chi_{H_{2}O} = \chi_{H_{2}O_{init}}\times\left(1-\frac{\Delta z}{150\times 10^{3}}\right)
\end{equation}
where $\chi_{H_{2}O_{init}}$ = 5 $wt.\%$ and $\Delta z$ is a marker's depth below the topographical surface.

If a rock marker dehydrates, an independent water particle is instantaneously generated at the same location with the respective $H_{2}O$ content. The new water particle is moved in accordance to the local velocity field, described by the following equation:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \vec{v}_{\text{water}} & = (\vec{v}_x,\ \vec{v}_z) \\
    \vec{v}_z & = \vec{v}_z - \vec{v}_{z(\text{percolation})} \\
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\vec{v}_{water}$ is the velocity vector of the water particle, $\vec{v}_{x}$ and $\vec{v}_{z}$ are the local velocity vectors of the solid state mantle or crust, and $\vec{v}_{z(percolation)}$ is a imposed constant upward percolation velocity (10 $cm/year$). We implicitly neglect kinetics of reactions, as material properties of markers change instantaneously at equilibrium reactions.

### Rheologic Sensitivity Tests on Plate Coupling {#rheologicSensitivity}

Numerical modelling practitioners simulating subduction zones approach mechanical coupling between plates differently. A simple, but highly effective approach, is prescribing a layer of arbitrary strength extending from the surface to an arbitrary depth or temperature along the plate interface. This approach effectively inhibits transfer of shear stress between plates and is analogous to controlling a no-slip condition at the interface (plates move with the same velocity vector beyond the coupling point). Numerous models use this method [e.g., @peacock1996; @peacock1999b; @wada2009; @syracuse2010] in part because it allows fine-tuning to specific subduction zone configurations. Serpentine-or talc-rich horizons are typically invoked to justify implementing such a condition at shallow interface depths.

The experiments outlined in Section \@ref(numMethods) do not explicitly define coupling, but rather use a rheologic model that explicitly follows experimentally determined flow laws and mineral stability fields. This approach conceptually follows and extends petrologic explanations for a weak interface [@hyndman2003; @peacock1999a]. As a corollary, dehydration of serpentine, or possibly talc, at higher temperatures must strengthen the interface [@agard2016]. Noting that talc is unstable at P $>$ 2.0 $GPa$ in an ultramafic rock [@schmidt1998], a serpentine rheology is arguably the most relevant candidate responsible for a strength increase, and thus coupling, at \gls{pt} conditions inferred for coupling in active subduction zones [@wada2009; @syracuse2010].

Sensitivity tests of the rheologic model presented in Section \@ref(rheologicModel) were run using diverse experiments adjusting the rheology of serpentine (compared to Table \@ref(tab:materials)), the shape and position of the antigorite-out reaction (compared to \@ref(eq:antstab)), and certain hydrodynamic parameters. For brevity, these results are not presented here. The experiments included:

1. antigorite $\leftarrow$ wet olivine flow law
2. antigorite and wet olivine $\leftarrow$ dry olivine flow law
3. isothermal antigorite reaction at 690 $^{\circ}C$
4. antigorite reaction isothermal Clapeyron slope at 715 $^{\circ}C$
5. antigorite reaction with positive linear Clapeyron slope
6. linear release of $H_{2}O$ with depth
7. no fluid-induced weakening

Only experiments 5 and 7 listed above were inconsistent with the results presented Section \@ref(chpt2Results). Experiment 5 results in transient coupling depths and discontinuous antigorite stability in the upper-plate mantle, whereas experiment 7 results in two-sided subduction [e.g., @gerya2008]. These sensitivity experiments imply numerical coupling mechanisms are mostly contingent on fluid flux to the upper-plate mantle and the implementation of serpentine stability. The experiments also show coupling is relatively insensitive to the exact flow law parameters.

### Surface Heat Flow

```{r hf, fig.cap='Surface heat flow calculated at approximately 10 $Ma$ for all numerical experiments. Normalized distance is the distance from the left boundary to the trench, divided by the distance between the trench and arc. Grayscale corresponds to $\\Phi$.

In the backarc region (normalized distance $\\geq$ 1.0), these fluctuations correspond to lithospheric extension. Backarc extension is most apparent for high-$\\Phi$ experiments (lighter gray lines).

### ThermoGlobe Summary

(ref:hfSummaryPlotCap) Distribution of ThermoGlobe observations from @lucazeau2019 cropped within 1000 $km$-radius buffers around 13 active subduction zone segments. Heat flow distributions are centered between `r min(hf.summary$median)` and `r max(hf.summary$median)` $mWm^{-2}$, generally right-skewed, and irregularly distributed. Skewness reflects near-surface perturbations from geothermal systems and tectonic regions with high thermal activity while irregularity reflects complex heat exchange acting across multiple spatial scales from 10$^-1$ to 10$^3$ $km$.

### Kriging System and Optimization {#krigeOpt}

#### Ordinary Kriging

This study applies local isotropic ordinary Kriging methods under the following general assumptions:

- $\hat{\gamma}(h)$ is directionally invariant (isotropic)
- $\hat{\gamma}(h)$ is evaluated in two-dimensions and neglects elevation
- The first and second moments of $Z(u)$ are assumed to follow the conditions:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    &E[Z(u)] = \hat{Z}(u) = constant \\
    &E[(Z(u + h) - \hat{Z}(u))(Z(u) - \hat{Z}(u))] = C(h)
  \end{aligned}
  (\#eq:krigeAssumptions)
\end{equation}
where $h$ is the lag distance, $C(h)$ is the covariance function, $E[Z(u)]$ is the expected value of the random variable $Z(u)$, and $\hat{Z}(u)$ is the arithmetic mean of $Z(u)$.

Equation \@ref(eq:krigeAssumptions) is known as "weak second-order stationarity". It assumes the underlying probability distribution of the observations $Z(u)$ does not change in space and the covariance $C(h)$ only depends on the distance $h$ between two observations. These assumptions are expected to be valid in cases where the underlying natural process is stochastic, spatially continuous, and has the property of additivity such that $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n Z(u_i)$ has the same meaning as $Z(u)$ [@bardossy1997].

The following are two illustrative cases where Equation \@ref(eq:krigeAssumptions) is likely valid:

> The thickness of a sedimentary unit with a homogeneous concentration of radioactive elements can be approximated by $q_s = q_b + \int A \,dz$, where $q_b$ is a constant heat flux entering the bottom of the layer and $A$ is the heat production within the layer with thickness $z$ [@furlong2013]. If one has two samples, $Z(u_1) = 31~mW/m^2$ and $Z(u_2) = 30.5~mW/m^2$, their corresponding thicknesses would be $Z'(u_1) = 1000~m$ and $Z'(u_2) = 500~m$ for $A = 0.001~mW/m^3$ and $q_b = 30~mW/m^2$. The variable, $Z(u)$, in this case is additive because the arithmetic mean of the samples is a good approximation of the average sedimentary layer thickness, $(Z(u_1) + Z(u_2)) / 2 = 750~m$.

> The age of young oceanic lithosphere can be approximated by $q_s(t) = kT_b(\pi\kappa t)^{-1/2}$, where $q_s(t)$ is surface heat flow of a plate with age, $t$, $T_b$ is the temperature at the base of the plate, $k$ is thermal conductivity, and $\kappa = k/\rho C_p$ is thermal diffusivity [@stein1992]. Using reasonable values for $k = 3.138~W/mK$, $\rho = 3330~kg/m^3$, $C_p = 1171~J/kgK$, $T_b = 1350^{\circ}C$, two samples, $Z(u_1) = 180~mW/m^2$ and $Z(u_2) = 190~mW/m^2$, would correspond to plates with ages of $Z'(u_1) = 10~Ma$, and $Z'(u_2) = 9~Ma$, respectively. Since $Z(u_1) + Z(u_2) / 2 = 185~mW/m^2$ and $Z'(185~mW/m^2) = 9.5~Ma = Z'(u_1) + Z'(u_2) / 2$, the variable $Z(u)$ in this case is also additive.

Equation \@ref(eq:krigeAssumptions) is likely invalid in regions that transition among two or more tectonic regimes, however. For example, the expected (mean) heat flow $E[Z(u)]$ will change when moving from a spreading center to a subduction zone and thus $E[Z(u)] \neq constant$ over the region of interest. In other words, stationarity is violated and Kriging estimates may become spurious. Careful selection of Kriging parameters (outlined below; e.g. maximum point-pairs to use for local Kriging) can reduce or eliminate violations of stationarity assumptions embodied in \@ref(eq:krigeAssumptions).

The second step is fitting a variogram model $\gamma(h)$ to the experimental variogram. This study fits six popular variogram models with sills (or theoretical sills) to the experimental variogram. The models are defined as [@pebesma2004]:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    Bes &\leftarrow \gamma(h) = 1 - \frac{h}{a}\ K_1\left(\frac{h}{a}\right) \quad \text{for } \  h \geq 0 \\
    Cir &\leftarrow \gamma(h) =
    \begin{cases}
      \frac{2}{\pi}\frac{h}{a}\ \sqrt{1-\left(\frac{h}{a}\right)^2} + \frac{2}{\pi}\ arcsin\left(\frac{h}{a}\right) \quad \text{for } \  0 \leq h \leq a \\
      n + s \quad \text{for } \  h > a
    \end{cases} \\
    Exp &\leftarrow \gamma(h) = 1 - exp\left(\frac{-h}{a}\right) \quad \text{for } \  h \geq 0 \\
    Gau &\leftarrow \gamma(h) = 1 - exp\left(\left[\frac{-h}{a}\right]^2\right) \quad \text{for } \  h \geq 0 \\
    Lin &\leftarrow \gamma(h) =
    \begin{cases}
      \frac{h}{a} \quad \text{for } \  0 \leq h \leq a \\
      n + s \quad \text{for } \  h > a
    \end{cases} \\
    Sph &\leftarrow \gamma(h) =
    \begin{cases}
      \frac{3}{2}\frac{h}{a} - \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{h}{a}\right)^3 \quad \text{for } \  0 \leq h \leq a \\
      n + s \quad \text{for } \  h > a
    \end{cases} \\
  \end{aligned}
  (\#eq:varMods)
\end{equation}
where $n$ is the nugget, $s$ is the sill, $a$ is the effective range, $K_1$ is a modified Bessel function. The models are Bessel, Circular, Exponential, Gaussian, Linear, and Spherical. For models without explicit sills (Bes, Exp, Gau), the effective range $a$ is the distance where the variogram reaches 95% of its maximum defined as 4$a$, 3$a$, and $\sqrt{3}a$ for Bes, Exp, and Gau, respectively [@graler2016; @pebesma2004]. The function `fit.variogram` in `gstat` is used to try all variogram models. The best model is selected by the minimum weighted least squares [@pebesma2004] error with weights proportional to the number of points in each lag divided by the squared lag distance $wt = N(h)_k/h_k^2)$. Gaussian models produce spurious results in every case and are not included in the final analysis. Moreover, Circular models produce indistinguishable results from Spherical models, and so too were omitted from the final analysis.

Ordinary Kriging is used for interpolation, which estimates unknown observations $\hat{Z}(u)$ as a linear combination of all known observations [@bardossy1997]:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{Z}(u) = \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i Z(u_i)
  (\#eq:linEstimate)
\end{equation}

The conditions in Equation \@ref(eq:krigeAssumptions) set up a constrained minimization problem that can be solved with a system of linear equations. The expected value of $Z(u)$ is assumed to be the mean according to \@ref(eq:krigeAssumptions), so the weights must be:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    E[\hat{Z}(u)] &= \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i E[Z(u_i)] \\
    \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i &= 1
  \end{aligned}
  (\#eq:unbiased)
\end{equation}

This constraint is known as the unbiased condition, which states that the sum of the weights must equal one. However, there is an infinite set of real numbers one could use for the weights, $\lambda_i$. The goal is to find the set of weights in Equation \@ref(eq:linEstimate) that minimizes the estimation variance. This can be solved by minimizing the covariance function, $C(h)$ from Equation \@ref(eq:krigeAssumptions):
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    & \sigma^2(u) = Var[Z(u) - \hat{Z}(u)] = \\
    & E\left[(Z(u) - \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i Z(u_i))^2\right] = \\
    & E\left[Z(u)^2 + \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_j \lambda_i Z(u_j)Z(u_i) - 2 \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i Z(u_i)Z(u)\right] = \\
    & C(0) + \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_j \lambda_i C(u_i - u_j) - 2 \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i C(u_i - u)
  \end{aligned}
  (\#eq:minVar)
\end{equation}

Minimizing Equation \@ref(eq:minVar) with respect to the unbiased condition (Equation \@ref(eq:unbiased)), yields the best linear unbiased estimator [BLUE, @bardossy1997] for Equation \@ref(eq:linEstimate) and together comprise the Kriging system of equations. The functions `krige` and `krige.cv` in `gstat` are used for surface heat flow interpolation and error estimation by k-fold cross-validation [@pebesma2004].

#### Optimization with `nloptr` {#nloptr}

Achieving accurate Kriging results depends on one's choice of many Kriging parameters, $\Theta$. In this study, we investigate a set of parameters:
\begin{equation} 
  \Theta = \{model,\ n,\ c,\ n_{max},\ l\}
  (\#eq:params)
\end{equation}
where $model$ is one of the variogram models defined in Equation \@ref(eq:varMods), $n$ is the number of lags, $c$ is a lag cutoff proportionality constant, $n_{max}$ is the maximum point-pairs for local Kriging, and $l$ is a horizontal lag shift constant. The lag cutoff constant $c$ controls the maximum separation distance between pairs of points used to calculate the experimental variogram (i.e. the x-axis range or "width" of the experimental variogram). The horizontal lag shift constant $l$ removes the first few lags from being evaluated by effectively shifting all lags to the left proportionally by $l$. This is necessary to avoid negative ranges when fitting experimental variograms with anomalously high variances at small lag distances.

The goal is to find $\Theta$ such that the Kriging function $f(x_i;\ \Theta)$ gives the minimum error defined by a cost function $C(\Theta)$, which represents the overall goodness of fit of the interpolation. This study defines a cost function that simultaneously considers errors between the experimental variogram $\hat{\gamma}(h)$ and modelled variogram $\gamma(h)$, and between surface heat flow observations $Z(u_i)$ and Kriging estimates $\hat{Z}(u)$ [after @li2018]:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    C(\Theta) &= w_{vgrm}\ C_{vgrm}(\Theta) + w_{interp}\ C_{interp}(\Theta) \\
    &w_{vgrm} + w_{interp} = 1
  \end{aligned}
  (\#eq:cost)
\end{equation}
where $C_{vgrm}(\Theta)$ is the normalized \glsfirst{rmse} evaluated during variogram fitting and $C_{interp}(\Theta)$ is the normalized \gls{rmse} evaluated during Kriging. Weighted ordinary least squares is used to evaluate $C_{vgrm}(\Theta)$, whereas k-fold cross-validation is used to evaluate $C_{interp}(\Theta)$. K-fold splits the dataset $|Z(u_i)|$ into $k$ equal intervals, removes observations from an interval, and then estimates the removed observations by fitting a variogram model to data in the remaining $k-1$ intervals. This process is repeated over all $k$ intervals so that the whole dataset has been cross-validated. The final expression to minimize becomes:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    &C(\Theta) = \\
    &\frac{w_{vgrm}}{\sigma_{vgrm}}\ \left(\frac{1}{N(h)}\ \sum_{k=1}^{N}\ w(h_k)\ [\hat{\gamma}(h_k)-\gamma(h_k;\ \Theta)]^2\right)^{1/4} + \\
    &\frac{w_{interp}}{\sigma_{interp}}\ \left(\frac{1}{M}\ \sum_{i=1}^{M}\ [Z(u_i)-\hat{Z}(u_i;\ \Theta)]^2\right)^{1/2}
  \end{aligned}
  (\#eq:costExp)
\end{equation}
where $N(h)$ is the number of point-pairs used to evaluate the experimental variogram and $w(h_k) = N(h)_k/h_k^2$ are weights defining the importance of the $kth$ lag on the variogram model fit.  $Z(u_i)$ and $\hat{Z}(u_i;\ \Theta)$ are the observed and estimated values, respectively, and $M$ is the number of measurements in $|Z(u_i)|$. The \glspl{rmse} are normalized by dividing by $\sigma_{vgrm}$ and $\sigma_{interp}$, which represent the standard deviation of the experimental variogram $\hat{\gamma}(h)$ and surface heat flow observations $Z(u_i)$, respectively. The weights $w_{vgrm}$ and $w_{interp}$ were varied between 0 and 1 to test the effects on $C(\Theta)$. Preferred weights of $w_{vgrm}$ = $w_{interp}$ = 0.5 are selected to balance the effects of $C_{vgrm}(\Theta)$ and $C_{interp}(\Theta)$ on the cost function.

(ref:vgrmSummaryPlotCap) Summary of optimized Kriging parameters. Cost does not correlate strongly with most Kriging parameters (solid black line with ivory 95% confidence intervals), indicating the optimization procedure is successfully generalizeable across subduction zone segments. The exception is a correlation between cost and the logarithm of the experimental variogram sill. Note that parameter values adjust from an initial value (solid white line) during the optimization procedure.

```

Minimization of $C(\Theta)$ is achieved by non-linear constrained optimization using algorithms defined in the `R` package `nloptr` [@ypma2014]. Global search methods had limited success compared to local search methods. Please see [the official documentation](https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/NLopt_Introduction/) for more information on `nloptr` and available optimization algorithms. The run used to produce the visualizations in Chapter \@ref(chpt3) uses the (Constrained Optimization BY Linear Approximation) `NLOPT_LN_COBYLA` method [@powell1994] with 50 max iterations, leave-one-out cross-validation (k-fold $=$ the number of observations) in the evaluated segment, and cost function weights of $w_{vgrm}$ = $w_{interp}$ = 0.5 (Figure \@ref(fig:optTrace)). All data, code, and instructions to reproduce results in this chapter can be found at \url{https://github.com/buchanankerswell/kerswell_kohn_backarc}.

(ref:optTraceCap) Cost function minimization for Kriging interpolations presented in Chapter \@ref(chpt3). Most variogram models (panels) converge on a local optimum for most Kriging domains (lines) after 15-20 iterations. Each line represents one of thirteen subduction zone segments. See text for bound constraints and other options passed to the optimization procedure.

### Comparing Similarity and Kriging Interpolations {#interpDiffAppendix}

Differences are centered near zero with medians ranging from `r min(interp.diff$median)` to `r max(interp.diff$median)` $mWm^{-2}$, but broadly distributed with interquartile ranges from `r min(interp.diff$IQR)` to `r max(interp.diff$IQR)` $mWm^{-2}$ and some long tails extending from `r min(interp.diff$min)` to `r max(interp.diff$max)` $mWm^{-2}$. Positive medians and right skew indicate a general tendency towards higher surface heat flow predictions by Similarity compared to Kriging. The broadest distributions (Andes and Central America) reflect less subtle differences between methods. Distributions are colored by quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%).

# Computing Rates and Distributions of Rock Recovery in Subduction Zones

### Gaussian Mixture Models {#gmm}

Let the traced markers represent a $d$-dimensional array of $n$ random independent variables $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$. Assume markers $x_i$ were drawn from $k$ discrete probability distributions with parameters $\Phi$. The probability distribution of markers $x_i$ can be modeled with a mixture of $k$ components:
\begin{equation}
  p(x_i | \Phi) = \sum_{j=1}^k \pi_j p(x_i | \Theta_j)
  (\#eq:gmix)
\end{equation}
where $p(x_i | \Theta_j)$ is the probability of $x_i$ under the $j^{th}$ mixture component and $\pi_j$ is the mixture proportion representing the probability that $x_i$ belongs to the $j^{th}$ component $(\pi_j \geq 0; \sum_{j=1}^k \pi_j = 1)$.

Assuming $\Theta_j$ describes a Gaussian probability distributions with mean $\mu_j$ and covariance $\Sigma_j$, Equation \@ref(eq:gmix) becomes:
\begin{equation}
  p(x_i | \Phi) = \sum_{j=1}^k \pi_j \mathcal{N}(x_i | \mu_j, \Sigma_j)
  (\#eq:mix)
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{N}(x_i | \mu_j, \Sigma_j) = \frac{exp\{ -\frac{1}{2}(x_i - \mu_j)(x_i - \mu_j)^T \Sigma_j^{-1}\}}{\sqrt{det(2 \pi \Sigma_j)}}
  (\#eq:gauss)
\end{equation}

The parameters $\mu_j$ and $\Sigma_j$, representing the center and shape of each cluster, are estimated by maximizing the log of the likelihood function, $L(x_i | \Phi) = \prod_{i=1}^n p(x_i | \Phi)$:
\begin{equation}
  log~L(x_i | \Phi) = log \prod_{i=1}^n p(x_i | \Phi) = \sum_{i=1}^n log \left[ \sum_{j=1}^k \pi_j p(x_i | \Theta_j) \right]
  (\#eq:loglik)
\end{equation}

Taking the derivative of Equation \@ref(eq:loglik) with respect to each parameter, $\pi$, $\mu$, $\Sigma$, setting the equation to zero, and solving for each parameter gives the maximum likelihood estimators:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    N_j &= \sum_{i=1}^n \omega_{i} \\
    \pi_j &= \frac{N_j}{n} \\
    \mu_j &= \frac{1}{N_j} \sum_{i=1}^n \omega_{i} x_i \\
    \Sigma_j &= \frac{1}{N_j} \sum_{i=1}^n \omega_{i} (x_i - \mu_j)(x_i - \mu_j)^T
  \end{aligned}
  (\#eq:mle)
\end{equation}
where $\omega_{i}$ ($\omega_{i} \geq 0; \sum_{j=1}^k \omega_{i} = 1$) are membership weights representing the probability of an observation $x_i$ belonging to the $j^{th}$ Gaussian and $N_j$ represents the number of observations belonging to the $j^{th}$ Gaussian. Please note that $\omega_{i}$ is unknown for markers so maximum likelihood estimator cannot be computed with Equation \@ref(eq:mle). The solution to this problem is the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, which is defined below.

General purpose functions in the `R` package `Mclust` [@scrucca2016] are used to fit Gaussian mixture models. "Fitting" refers to adjusting all $k$ Gaussian parameters $\mu_j$ and $\Sigma_j$ until the data and Gaussian ellipsoids achieve maximum likelihood defined by Equation \@ref(eq:loglik). After @banfield1993, covariance matrices $\Sigma$ in `Mclust` are parameterized to be flexible in their shape, volume, and orientation [@scrucca2016]:
\begin{equation}
  \Sigma_j = \lambda_j D_j A_j D_j^T
  (\#eq:eigen)
\end{equation}
where $D_j$ is the orthogonal eigenvector matrix, $A_j$ and $\lambda_j$ are diagonal matrices of values proportional to the eigenvalues. This implementation allows fixing one, two, or three geometric elements of the covariance matrices. That is, the volume $\lambda_j$, shape $A_j$, and orientation $D_j$ of Gaussian clusters can change or be fixed among all $k$ clusters [e.g., @celeux1995; @fraley2002]. Fourteen parameterizations of Equation \@ref(eq:eigen) are tried, representing different geometric combinations of the covariance matrices $\Sigma$ [see @scrucca2016] and the Bayesian information criterion is computed [@schwarz1978]. The parameterization for Equation \@ref(eq:eigen) is chosen by Bayesian information criterion.

### Expectation-Maximization

The Expectation-Maximization algorithm estimates Gaussian mixture model parameters by initializing $k$ Gaussians with parameters $(\pi_j, \mu_j, \Sigma_j)$, then iteratively computing membership weights with Equation \@ref(eq:posterior) and updating Gaussian parameters with Equation \@ref(eq:mle) until reaching a convergence threshold [@dempster1977].

The *expectation* (E-)step involves a "latent" multinomial variable $z_{i} \in \{1, 2, \dots, k\}$ representing the unknown classifications of $x_i$ with a joint distribution $p(x_i,z_{i}) = p(x_i | z_{i})p(z_{j})$. Membership weights $\omega_{i}$ are equivalent to the conditional probability $p(z_{i} | x_i)$, which represents the probability of observation $x_i$ belonging to the $j^{th}$ Gaussian. Given initial guesses for Gaussian parameters $\pi_j$, $\mu_j$, $\Sigma_j$, membership weights are computed using Bayes Theorem (E-step):
\begin{equation}
  p(z_{i} | x_i) = \frac{p(x_i | z_{i})p(z_{j})}{p(x_i)} = \frac{\pi_j \mathcal{N}(\mu_j, \Sigma_j)}{\sum_{j=1}^k \pi_j \mathcal{N}(\mu_j, \Sigma_j)} = \omega_{i}
  (\#eq:posterior)
\end{equation}
and Gaussian estimates are updated during the *maximization* (M-)step by applying $\omega_{i}$ to Equation \@ref(eq:mle). This step gives markers $x_i$ class labels $z_i \in \{1, \dots, k\}$ representing assignment to one of $k$ clusters (Figure \@ref(fig:class)).

### Thermal Parameter Effects

(ref:phiDensityCap) Marker PT distribution by thermal parameter $\Phi$. Changing patterns to the probability density of recovered markers (filled gray contours) with respect to thermal parameter appear non-systematic. A general change in morphology towards flatter, more segregated bimodal distributions is observed with increasing thermal parameter. The more continuous distributions for $\Phi$ of 13, 22, 34, and 44 stand out because these models correspond to the slowest-converging simulations (see Figure \@ref(fig:recRate)).

## Abstract {#chpt2Abstract}

Deep mechanical coupling between converging plates is implicated in plate motions, crustal deformation, seismic cycles, arc magmatism, detachment of subducting material, and is considered a key feature of \glsfirst{sz} geodynamics. This study uses two-dimensional numerical models of oceanic-continental convergent margins to investigate effects of \glsfirst{tkbc} on coupling---specifically focusing on thermal parameter ($\Phi$) and \glsfirst{upt}. Numerical experiments implement coupling by including the metamorphic (de)hydration reaction $antigorite \allowbreak \Leftrightarrow olivine + orthopyroxene + H_{2}O$ in the upper-plate mantle. Visualizing \glsfirst{pts} fields show thermal feedbacks regulating \glsfirst{cd} dynamically with strong responses to \gls{upt} and weak responses to $\Phi$. The results imply estimation of \gls{cd} is possible by inverting \gls{upt} from \glsfirst{shf}. Moreover, \gls{shf} sampled from the backarc region near 17 active \glspl{sz} imply consistent \gls{upt}, and thus uniform \glspl{cd} among \glspl{sz}.

## Introduction {#chpt2Intro}

Subduction geodynamics are largely defined by plate motions and mechanical behaviour along the plate interface. For example, a transition from mechanically decoupled (moving differentially with respect to each other) to coupled plates (moving with the same local velocity) dramatically increases temperature by inducing mantle circulation in the upper-plate [@peacock1994; @peacock1996]. Observations from numerical experiments and forearc \gls{shf} imply coupling transitions occurring globally within a narrow range of depths in modern \glspl{sz} (70-80 $km$). Further, coupling appears essentially unresponsive to important \gls{tkbc}, including oceanic-plate age, convergence velocity, and subduction geometry [@furukawa1993; @wada2008; @wada2009]. While uniform \glspl{cd} among \glspl{sz} are inferred from different datasets, this phenomenon remains curious and unconfirmed to a large extent. To understand \gls{sz} geodynamics, it is essential to understand why modern \glspl{sz} appear to achieve similar \glspl{cd} despite differences in their physical characteristics.

Notwithstanding, many numerical geodynamic models use \glspl{cd} of 70-80 $km$ as a boundary condition [@abers2017; @currie2004; @syracuse2010; @vankeken2011; @vankeken2018; @wada2012; @gao2014; @wilson2014], although not exclusively [e.g. 40-56 $km$, @england2010; @peacock1996]. Similar \glspl{cd} among \glspl{sz} is an attractive hypothesis for at least two reasons. First, it helps explain a relatively narrow range of depths to subducting oceanic-plates beneath volcanic arcs [@england2004; @syracuse2006] as mechanical coupling is expected to be closely associated with the onset of flux melting. Second, mechanical coupling is required to detach crustal fragments from the subducting plate [@agard2016], so uniform \glspl{cd} may also help explain why maximum pressures recorded by subducted oceanic material worldwide is $\leq$ 2.3-2.5 $GPa$ [roughly 80 $km$, @agard2009; @agard2018].

The location and extent of mechanical coupling along the plate interface is implicated in myriad geodynamic phenomena, including seismicity, metamorphism, volatile flux, volcanism, plate motions, and crustal deformation [@cizkova2013; @gonzalez2016; @hirauchi2010; @peacock1990; @peacock1991; @peacock1993; @peacock1996; @peacock1999a; @hacker2003; @vankeken2011; @grove2012; @gao2017]. Consequently, the mechanics of coupling have been extensively studied and discussed. Coupling fundamentally depends on the strength (viscosity) of materials above, within, and below the plate interface. Water flux from compaction and dehydration of hydrous minerals with increasing \glsfirst{pt} forms layers of low viscosity sheet silicates near the plate interface. Transmission of shear stress between plates is inhibited by formation of talc and serpentine in the shallow upper-plate mantle [@peacock1999a]. Lack of traction along the interface, combined with cooling from the subducting plate surface, ensures a positive feedback between hydrous mineral formation and mechanical decoupling. Experimentally determined flow laws, petrologic observations, and geophysical observations all support the plausibility of this conceptual model of subduction interface behaviour [e.g., @agard2016; @agard2018; @gao2014; @peacock1999a].

Experimental control over important \gls{tkbc} makes numerical modelling essential for investigating such complex geodynamic environments. @wada2009 previously investigated the effects of $\Phi$ on \glspl{cd} by numerically simulating 17 active \glspl{sz}. Among other \gls{tkbc}, their models specify convergence rate, subduction geometry, thermal structure of oceanic- and overriding-plates, and degree of coupling along the subduction interface. Notably, their experiments control for interface rheology and discriminate best-fit \glspl{cd} based on observed forearc \gls{shf}.

This study similarly specifies \gls{tkbc} to numerically simulate the range of modern \gls{sz} systems, but regulates interface rheology dynamically by implementing metamorphic reactions that respond to evolving \gls{pts} fields. Subduction geometry and \gls{cd} are not fully determined features, in other words, but rather spontaneous model outcomes within the range of specified boundary conditions discussed in section \@ref(numMethods). As in previous studies [e.g., @ruh2015], rheological effects of the dehydration reaction $antigorite \allowbreak \Leftrightarrow olivine + orthopyroxene + H_{2}O$ are implemented to drive mechanical coupling. An abrupt viscosity increase accompanies antigorite (serpentine) destabilization, thereby inducing mechanical coupling, as defined by empirically-determined flow laws used in the experiments (Table \@ref(tab:materials)).

This chapter focuses on two fundamental questions. How does \gls{cd} respond to $\Phi$ *and* \gls{upt}? And how stable is \gls{cd} through time? First, 64 convergent margins with variable \gls{upt} and $\Phi$ are numerically simulated and mechanical plate coupling is observed. Thermal feedbacks within the system are visualized in terms of mantle temperature, viscosity, and velocity fields and \gls{cd} responses to a range of $\Phi$ and \gls{upt} are quantified using multi-variate linear regression. Three different regression models are then used to estimate \glspl{cd} for 17 active \glspl{sz}. \gls{cd} estimates fall within similarly narrow ranges, regardless of regression model form. Implications and questions about \gls{upt} and \gls{cd} uniformity among \glspl{sz} are finally discussed before further investigation into \gls{shf} in Chapter \@ref(chpt3).

## Numerical modelling methods {#numMethods}

This study simulates converging oceanic-continental plates, where an ocean basin is being consumed by subduction at a continental margin (Figure \@ref(fig:init)). Initial conditions are modified from previous numerical experiments of active margins [@sizova2010; @gorczyk2007] using the code `I2VIS` [@gerya2003], although plate coupling was not the focus of their studies. Identical rheologic model, material properties (Table\@ref(tab:materials)), and hydration/melt model (Table \@ref(tab:melts) & Appendix \@ref(deHydration)) as @sizova2010 are used. However, the version of `I2VIS` in this study differs from @sizova2010 in its initial setup, overall dimension, resolution, continental geotherm, dehydration model, and left boundary condition (origin of new oceanic lithosphere). Differences are outlined in this section and in Appendix \@ref(deHydration). Sixty-four `I2VIS` models constructed with varying convergence rates ($\vec{v}_{conv}$), oceanic-plate ages ($t_{OP}$), and \glspl{upt} (Figure \@ref(fig:params)) were ran on the [Euler cluster](https://scicomp.ethz.ch/wiki/Euler) at ETH, ZÃ¼rich until achieving at least 10 $Ma$ of subduction.

### Initial setup and boundary conditions {#numBCs}

Simulations are 2000 $km$ wide and 300 $km$ deep (Figure \@ref(fig:init)). In the model domain, three governing equations of heat transport, momentum, and continuity are discretized and solved with a conservative finite-difference marker-in-cell approach on a fully staggered grid as outlined in @gerya2003. Numerical resolution is non-uniform with higher resolution (1 $km$ x 1 $km$) in a 600 $km$ wide area surrounding the contact between the oceanic-plate and continental margin, then gradually changing to lower resolution towards the model boundaries (5 $km$ x 1 $km$, x- and z-directions, respectively). The left and right boundaries are free-slip and thermally insulating (Figure \@ref(fig:init)a, b). Implementation of "sticky" air and water allows for a free topographical surface with a simple linear sedimentation and erosion model. The lower boundary is open to allow for oceanic-plate descent with a spontaneous subduction angle [@burg2005].

A horizontal convergence force is applied to both plates in a rectangular region far from the continental margin (Figure \@ref(fig:init)c). An initial weak layer cutting the lithosphere permits subduction to initiate. The high-viscosity ($\eta = 10^{25}~Pa\cdot s$) rectangular convergence regions apply constant horizontal velocities without deforming the lithosphere. Subduction angle is governed by free-motion of the subducting plate. Similarly, subduction velocity varies with time in response to extension or shortening of the overriding plate. $\Phi$ is thus calculated as the product of the horizontal convergence velocity and the oceanic-plate age [c.f. @mckenzie1969]. For convenience and consistency with the literature, this study presents $\Phi$ in units of $km$/100 (Figure \@ref(fig:params)a).

```{r params, fig.cap='Range of thermo-kinematic boundary conditions used in numerical experiments.

### Calculating geotherms and defining lithospheric thickness {#numGeotherms}

Oceanic crust is modeled as 1 $km$ of sediment cover overlying 2 $km$ of basalt and 5 $km$ of gabbro (Figure \@ref(fig:init)a). Oceanic lithosphere is continually made at a pseudo-mid-ocean ridge at the left boundary of the model (Figure \@ref(fig:init)b). An enhanced vertical cooling condition applied at 200 $km$ from left boundary adjusts for the proper oceanic-plate age, and therefore its lithospheric thickness as it enters the trench [@agrusta2013]. Oceanic-plate ages range from 32.6 to 110 $Ma$ and convergence velocities from 40 to 100 $km/Ma$ (Figure \@ref(fig:params)a). This range of parameters broadly reflects the middle-range of modern global subduction systems [@syracuse2006].

Initial continental geotherms are determined by solving the heat flow equation in one-dimension to 1300 $^{\circ}C$ (Figure \@ref(fig:params)b). This study assumes a fixed temperature of 0 $^{\circ}C$ at the surface, constant radiogenic heating of 1 $\mu W/m^{3}$ in the 35 $km$-thick continental crust, 0.022 $\mu W/m^{3}$ in the mantle, with thermal conductivities of 2.3 $W/mK$ and 3.0 $W/mK$ for the continental crust and mantle, respectively. Above, 1300 $^{\circ}C$, temperature is assumed to constantly increase by 0.5 $^{\circ}C/km$ (the mantle adiabat) to the base of the model domain.

Many studies define the base of the continental lithosphere at the 1300 $^{\circ}C$ isotherm, but it can be determined directly by visualizing viscosity and strain rate as the model progresses. The mechanical base of the lithosphere ($Z_{UP}$) in the models generally occurs near the 1100 $^{\circ}C$ isotherm---characterized by a rapid decrease in viscosity and increase in strain rate (Figures \@ref(fig:cdfStep1), \@ref(fig:cdfStep2), \@ref(fig:cdfStep3)). As such, this study considers oceanic and continental lithospheres as mechanical layers defined by viscosity, rather than defined merely by temperature. $Z_{UP}$ corresponding to backarc surface heat flow of 59, 63, 69, and 79 $mW/m^{2}$ are used in this study (Figure \@ref(fig:params)b).

### Metamorphic (de)hydration reactions {#numHydration}

Using Lagrangian markers [@harlow1962; @harlow1964] to store and update material properties and \gls{pts} fields allows for straight-forward numerical implementation of metamorphic reactions. This approach is key to regulating mechanical coupling dynamically in \gls{sz} simulations. For example, dehydration (eclogitization) of the oceanic-plate and (de)stabilization of serpentine in the upper-plate mantle may be effectively modelled by tracing marker \gls{ptt} paths while changing marker properties according to thermodynamically-stable mineral assemblages [e.g., @connolly2005]. For computational efficiency, however, water contents in this study are not computed by iteratively solving thermodynamic systems of equations. Instead, gradual eclogitization of oceanic crust is computed as a linear function of lithostatic pressure to a maximum depth of 150 $km$, or temperature of 1427 $^\circ C$, while including garnet-in and plagioclase-out reactions defined by @ito1971. Mantle (de)hydration is computed according reactions boundaries defined by @schmidt1998 with a maximum water content of 2 $wt.\%$ (explained below). This approach effectively simulates continuous influx of water to the upper-plate mantle with relatively low computational cost, beginning with compaction and release of connate water at shallow depths, followed by a sequence of reactions consuming major hydrous phases (chlorite, lawsonite, zoisite, chloritoid, talc, amphibole, and phengite) in different parts of the hydrated basaltic crust [@schmidt1998; @vankeken2011].

The extent of metamorphic reaction effects on mechanical coupling, and the exact (de)hydration reaction(s) likely responsible, are unknown. However, formation of brucite and serpentine from dry olivine near the plate interface are inferred to strongly regulate mechanical behaviour [@hyndman2003; @peacock1999a; @agard2016]. Brucite notably breaks down at much lower temperatures than serpentine [@schmidt1998], so serpentine (de)stabilization arguably represents the key transition from a weak-to-strong upper-plate mantle deep in \glspl{sz}. This study elects an implementation of serpentine (de)hydration for this reason. The reaction is assumed to be abrupt and discontinuous, which is a fine approximation for near-endmember compositions like (Mg-rich) peridotites. The \gls{pt} conditions of the reaction $antigorite \Leftrightarrow olivine + orthopyroxene + H_{2}O$ were numerically implemented by the following equation [after @schmidt1998]:

\begin{equation}
  T_{atg-out}(z)=
  \begin{cases}
    751.50+6.008\times10^{-3}z-3.469\times10^{-8}z^2,& \text{for } z < 63000m \\
    1013.2-6.039\times10^{-5}z-4.289\times10{-9}z^2,& \text{for } z>63000m
  \end{cases}
  (\#eq:antstab)
\end{equation}

where $z$ is the depth of a marker from the surface in meters and $T$ is temperature in Kelvins. This reaction boundary is consistent to within 25 $^{\circ}C$ of more recent experiments by @shen2015. Markers with internal temperature exceeding $T_{atg-out}(z)$ spontaneously form $olivine + orthopyroxene + H_{2}O$ and release their crystal-bound water. This implementation tacitly assumes thermodynamic equilibrium and is common to many versions of `I2VIS`.

Oceanic-plates of different ages are also tacitly assumed to dehydrate similarly with the above implementation. However, older (colder) oceanic-plates are expected to carry water to greater depths than younger (warmer) plates because of relatively delayed water-releasing reactions [@peacock1996]. Abrupt water release with serpentine dehydration (Equation \@ref(eq:antstab)) was tested to model deep water retention in cold oceanic-plates. Mechanical coupling behaviour was indistinguishable from gradual water release models. This implies rates of water release are less important than the depth of serpentine stability. Explicitly modelling other major dehydration reactions are thus unlikely to significantly affect mechanical coupling behaviour, yet likely to introduce numerical artifacts at great computational cost. A simplified gradual water release model for all oceanic-plates is therefore preferred.

Water released by rock forms discrete fluid particles that migrate with relative velocities defined by local deviatoric (non-lithostatic) pressure gradients [see Appendix \@ref(deHydration), @faccenda2009]. Fluid velocities are scaled by a 10 $cm/yr$ vertical percolation velocity to account for purely lithostatic pressure gradients in the mantle [@gorczyk2007]. Fluid particles migrate until encountering rock that can consume additional water by equilibrium hydration or melting reactions, (Equation \@ref(tab:melts)).

The shallow upper-plate mantle can theoretically store large amounts of water as serpentine may contain up to 13 $wt.\%$ water [@reynard2013] and is generally stable at shallow mantle conditions. Thermodynamic models predict 8 $wt.\%$ water in the shallow upper-plate mantle [@connolly2005]. However, seismic studies suggest most shallow upper-plate mantles are only partially serpentinized (< 20-40%), equating to water contents of approximately 3-6 $wt.\%$ [@abers2017; @carlson2003]. Many modes of mantle hydration are documented or inferred, including evidence for channelized fluid flow within ophiolites exhumed from \glspl{sz} [@angiboust2012a; @angiboust2014; @zack2007; @plumper2017]. This study limits mantle wedge hydration to $\leq$ 2 $wt.\%~H_{2}O$ and assumes any excess $H_{2}O$ exits the system through channelized fluid flow during plastic or brittle deformation [@davies1999].

### Rheologic model {#rheologicModel}

Contributions from dislocation and diffusion creep are accounted for by computing a composite rheology for ductile rocks, $\eta_{effective}$:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \frac{1}{\eta_{effective}} = \frac{1}{\eta_{diff}} + \frac{1}{\eta_{disl}}
  \end{aligned} 
  (\#eq:ductile)
\end{equation}

where $\eta_{diff}$ and $\eta_{disl}$ are effective viscosities for diffusion and dislocation creep.

For the crust and serpentinized mantle, $\eta_{diff}$ and $\eta_{disl}$ are computed as:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \eta_{diff} &= \frac{1}{2} \ A \ \sigma_{crit}^{1-n} \ \exp\left[\frac{E+PV}{RT}\right] \\
    \eta_{disl} &= \frac{1}{2} \ A^{1/n} \ \dot{\varepsilon}_{II}^{(1-n)/n} \ \exp\left[\frac{E+PV}{nRT}\right]
  (\#eq:crust)
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where $R$ is the gas constant, $P$ is pressure, $T$ is temperature in $K$, ${\dot{\varepsilon}}_{II} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}{{\dot{\varepsilon}}_{ij}}^{2}}$ is the square root of the second invariant of the strain rate tensor, $\sigma_{crit}$ is an assumed diffusion-dislocation transition stress, and $A$, $E$, $V$ and $n$ are the material constant, activation energy, activation volume, and stress exponent, respectively [Table \@ref(tab:materials), @hilairet2007; @ranalli1995].

For the mantle, $\eta_{diff}$ and $\eta_{disl}$ are computed as [@karato1993]:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \eta_{diff} &= \frac{1}{2} \ A^{-1} \ G \ \left[\frac{h}{b}\right]^{m/n} \ \exp\left[\frac{E+PV}{RT}\right] \\
    \eta_{disl} &= \frac{1}{2} \ A^{-1/n} \ G \ \dot{\varepsilon}_{II}^{(1-n)/n} \ \exp\left[\frac{E+PV}{nRT}\right]
  \end{aligned}
  (\#eq:mantle)
\end{equation}

where $b$=$5\times10^{-10}$ $m$ is Burgers vector, $G$=$8\times10^{10}$ $Pa$ is shear modulus, $h$=$1\times10^{-3}$ $m$ is the assumed grain size, $m=2.5$ is the grain size exponent, and the other flow law parameters are given in Table \@ref(tab:materials). Our models limited viscosity for all rocks at $\eta_{min} = 10^{17}\ Pa \cdot s$ and $\eta_{max} = 10^{25}\ Pa \cdot s$.

An effective visco-plastic rheology is achieved by limiting $\eta_{effective}$ with a brittle (plastic) yield criterion:

\begin{equation}
  \eta_{effective} \leq \frac{C + \phi \ P}{2 \ \dot{\varepsilon}_{II}}
  (\#eq:plastic)
\end{equation}

where $\phi$ is the internal friction coefficient, $C$ cohesive strength at $P$ = 0, and ${\dot{\varepsilon}}_{ij}$ is the strain rate tensor (Table \@ref(tab:materials)).

### Visualization and determination of coupling depth

The rheologic model and \gls{tkbc} described in the previous sections always results in plate motions towards the left boundary (slab-rollback). Relatively high dip angles and extreme subduction velocities in some high-$\Phi$ experiments cause chaotic behaviour by 10 $Ma$ as the upper-plate is stretched thin and mechanical interference occurs between trench sediments and the high-viscosity convergence region 200 $km$ from the left boundary. Numerical solutions are stable for most experiments, however, reaching quasi-steady state by 5 $Ma$. An additional 5 $Ma$ is allowed to ensure stable geodynamics before observing \gls{cd}. Surface heat flow, rock type, temperature, viscosity, strain rate, shear heating, and velocity fields are visualized at approximately 10 $Ma$ (e.g., Figure \@ref(fig:comp)) for all 64 experiments to assess geodynamics and solution stability (Figure \@ref(fig:antDepth)).

```{r comp, fig.cap='Visualizing model cdf with a 78 $km$ upper-plate lithosphere at approximately 10 $Ma$. (a) Rock type shows a thin serpentine layer (pink) lubricating the plate interface. Note that low melt volumes are inconspicuous and quickly extracted. (b) Viscosity shows high contrast between the oceanic-plate and serpentinized upper-plate mantle at shallow levels. Viscosity contrast disappears where serpentine becomes unstable. (c) Streamlines show focused mantle flow towards the interface, coinciding with the lower limit of serpentine stability.

After approximately 10 $Ma$ of subduction \gls{cd} is determined directly from viscosity by finding the approximate area where strength contrasts between serpentinized- and non-serpentinized upper-plate mantle diminishes to $<$ 10$^2$ $Pa \cdot s$. The node nearest to this region is assigned as the \gls{cd}. This study assumes mechanical coupling occurs instantaneously and at a single node. Mechanical coupling in reality must be dispersed across a finite length along the plate interface, however. At the numerical resolution the experiments, coupling-like viscosity contrasts are similar within a small area (approximately 5 $\times$ 5 $km$ or 5 $\times$ 5 nodes), giving a qualitative uncertainty \gls{cd} on the order of 2.5 $km$.

## Results {#chpt2Results}

### Coupling depth estimators {#cdEstimators}

\gls{cd} ($Z_{cpl}$) correlates strongly with \gls{upt} ($Z_{UP}$) and weakly with $\Phi$ across all 64 numerical models (Table \@ref(tab:zcResults), Figures \@ref(fig:results) & \@ref(fig:biv)). The responsiveness of \gls{cd} to $Z_{UP}$ but not to $\Phi$ is a key result of our experiments. The following equation minimizes standard least squares while optimizing the number of parameters, *p value*, and $R^2$ for all possible permutations of the variables $Z_{UP}$ and $\Phi$ in linear and quadratic forms:

\begin{equation}
  Z_{cpl} = 4.95\times 10^{-3}\ Z_{UP}^{2}\ -\ 9.27\times 10^{-2}\ \Phi\ +\ 63.6
  (\#eq:zCpl)
\end{equation}

where $Z_{cpl}$ is coupling depth in $km$ and $\Phi$ is the thermal parameter in $km/100$. Regression summaries show both linear and quadratic models of $Z_{cpl}$ vs. $Z_{UP}$ and $\Phi$ fit experimental results well (Tables \@ref(tab:anova) & \@ref(tab:regSummary)). Equation \@ref(eq:zCpl) represents a statistical model formulated with observations from physics-based simulations of subduction. Equation \@ref(eq:zCpl) is useful for estimating \glspl{cd} in active \glspl{sz} where $\Phi$ is known and $Z_{UP}$ can be inverted from \gls{shf}.

Sensitivity of \gls{cd} to \gls{upt} and $\Phi$ is apparent when visualizing Equation \@ref(eq:zCpl) and other regression models across $Z_{UP}$ and $\Phi$ space \@ref(fig:multiv). Applying Equation \@ref(eq:zCpl) to 17 active \gls{sz} segments (Table \@ref(tab:segs)) gives a wide range of estimated \glspl{cd}, similar to our model simulations. The distribution of estimated \glspl{cd}, however, is relatively narrow and quasi-normal, with a mean of $\sim$ 82 $km$ and standard deviation of 7 $km$ (Figure \@ref(fig:multiv)d).

```{r multiv, fig.cap='Multivariate regressions and estimated coupling depth ($Z_{cpl}$) for 17 active \\gls{sz} segments.

### Surface heat flow

Upper-plate \gls{shf} remains relatively stable and reflects initial upper-plate geotherms in the backarc region for experiments with low to moderate $\Phi$ (Figure \@ref(fig:hf)). However, high-amplitude and high-frequency positive \gls{shf} deviations in the upper-plate are common in all experiments, especially for high-$\Phi$ experiments. These deviations correspond to extensional deformation and heat transport via lithospheric thinning and melt migration. These features are apparent as subvertical low viscosity, high strain rate columns originating from the plate interface (Figure \@ref(fig:comp)b, d) and point to potential sources of error when inverting \gls{shf} in active \glspl{sz}. Notably, the backarc is relatively unaffected by fluid and melt migration compared to the forearc. Estimating \gls{upt} by inverting \gls{shf} in the backarc is therefore preferable to forearc \gls{shf}.

```{r hf78, fig.cap='Surface heat flow ($\\vec{q}$) vs. normalized distance for model cdf with upper-plate thickness ($Z_{UP}$) ranging from 46 to 94 $km$. The distribution of $\\vec{q}$ in the forearc (normalized distance between 0.0 and 1.0) is narrow and shows little variance until near the arc (normalized distance between 0.75 and 1.0). The broad distribution of $\\vec{q}$ behind the arc (normalized distance $>$ 1.0) reflects the broad distribution of initial continental geotherms ($Z_{UP}$). Any simple relationship between $\\vec{q}$ and $Z_{UP}$ may be obscured by heating from extension or vertical migration of fluids, especially within the arc-region (high-amplitude fluctuations).', fig.scap='Surface heat flow calculated from numerical experiments'}

knitr::include_graphics('assets/figs/chpt2/fig5.png')

```

\gls{shf} across all numerical experiments is similar in the forearc region (normalized distance $\leq$ 0.75, Figure \@ref(fig:hf78)). In contrast, \gls{shf} extending behind the arc region (normalized distance $>$ 0.75, Figure \@ref(fig:hf78)) increases systematically, then levels off at values reflecting initial continental geotherms (i.e. reflecting initial \gls{upt}). In reality, \gls{shf} depend on fault slip rates and rates of volcanic outputs. However, heat flow in the behind the arc may remain in steady-state if rates of volcanism and crustal thinning by extension are low [@currie2004; @currie2006].

## Discussion {#chpt2Discussion}

### Dynamic feedbacks regulating plate coupling

A clear association between plate coupling and the reaction $antigorite \allowbreak \Leftrightarrow olivine + orthopyroxene + H_{2}O$ is observed in all experiments. A relatively narrow serpentine channel quickly forms above the dehydrating oceanic-plate, localizing strain, lubricating the plate interface, and inhibiting transfer of shear stress between plates [e.g., @agard2016; @ruh2015]. This mechanical behaviour is a direct consequence of a sharp rheologic change dependent on the location of serpentine dehydration reaction described in Section \@ref(numHydration) and its effect on the rheologic model described in Section \@ref(rheologicModel). Interactions among viscosity changes, serpentine dehydration, and heat transfer are regulated by competing dynamic feedbacks acting in the upper-plate. In summary, cooling and hydration of the shallow upper-plate mantle (serpentine stabilization) and heating from circulating asthenospheric mantle beneath the upper-plate lithosphere (driven by mechanical coupling) compete to stabilize \gls{cd} (Figure \@ref(fig:flow)).

The entire process can be conceptualized with Figure \@ref(fig:flow) as follows. The upper-plate mantle cools via diffusive heat loss to the oceanic-plate along the entire length of the plate interface (Figure \@ref(fig:flow)a). At shallow depths, water released from the oceanic-plate stabilizes serpentine in the overriding upper-plate mantle, effectively decoupling the two plates (Figure \@ref(fig:flow)b, point a). A positive feedback stabilizes serpentine to greater depths as decoupled plates stagnate the upper-plate mantle, promoting further cooling and formation of serpentine. Numerical experiments imply only a thin layer of serpentine is sufficient to trigger this feedback.

Deeper along the plate interface, beyond the stability of serpentine, diffusive heat loss from the upper-plate mantle to the slab forms a thickening layer of high-viscosity mantle atop the oceanic-plate (Figure \@ref(fig:flow)b, point b). Downward motion of the oceanic-plate, plus accreted high-viscosity mantle (Figure \@ref(fig:flow)b, point b) relative to the deepest extent of the stiff upper-plate mantle (Figure \@ref(fig:flow)b, point c) creates a pressure gradient that attracts flow of the weakest materials---serpentine from the up-dip direction (Figure \@ref(fig:flow)b, point d)---and hot mantle from below (Figure \@ref(fig:flow)b, point e). Flow of hot mantle into the necking region between points b and c in Figure \@ref(fig:flow) is analogous to passive asthenospheric upwelling toward a mid-ocean ridge where two strong cooling lithospheric plates diverge. Highly efficient heat advection from the warm upper-plate asthenospheric mantle (Figure \@ref(fig:flow)a) prevents formation of sperentine---thus regulating and stabilizing the \gls{cd}.

Coupling mechanics apparent from numerical experiments can be described in terms of competing positive and negative feedbacks. The positive feedback involves addition of water into a diffusively cooling, shallow mantle to produce serpentine. The negative feedback involves serpentine destabilization by advection of heat from the deeper upper-plate asthenospheric mantle. Such thermal-petrologic-mechanical feedbacks drive \gls{cd} towards steady-state. Our results imply a finely-tuned balance of serpentine stability can maintain \glspl{cd} in \glspl{sz} for potentially 10's of Ma.

### Coupling responses to $Z_{UP}$ and $\Phi$ {#cplResponses}

How does \gls{upt} influence \gls{cd}? Numerical experiments point to the upper-plate lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary as an important feature constraining coupling mechanics as it defines the permissible flow field in the upper-plate (Figure \@ref(fig:streams)a-d). Thin upper-plate lithospheres (Figure \@ref(fig:streams)a, b) permit shallow mantle flow and advection of heat farther up the plate interface. Thin upper-plate lithospheres thereby raise coupling depths by raising serpentine stability up the plate interface. Thick upper-plate lithospheres (Figure \@ref(fig:streams)c, d) restrict mantle wedge flow to deeper levels, deepening serpentine stability and mechanical coupling.

The thermal state of the slab, as represented by $\Phi$, has almost no effect on \gls{cd} by comparison. Relative insensitivity of \gls{cd} to $\Phi$ is consistent with previous studies of active \glspl{sz} [@furukawa1993; @wada2009]. The irresponsiveness of \gls{cd} to changes in $\Phi$ is perhaps  due to competing cooling and heating effects driven by the subducting oceanic-plate. For example, high-$\Phi$ oceanic-plates (older plates with higher velocities) cool the upper-plate mantle more effectively, but also effectively heat the interface by driving stronger mantle circulation. In contrast, low-$\Phi$ oceanic-plates (younger plates with lower velocities) are less effective in cooling the upper-plate mantle, but also ineffectively heat the interface by ineffectively driving mantle circulation. That is, the shallow vs. deep dynamic effects of $\Phi$ tend to cancel each other, explaining the lack of correlation between \gls{cd} and $\Phi$.

### Estimating coupling depths in subduction zones

Theoretically, \gls{cd} can be estimated directly by fitting forearc \gls{shf} data using forward modelling approaches [e.g., @wada2009]. However, forward approaches typically adjust \gls{cd} independently from \gls{upt}, which is inconsistent with an inherent link between \gls{cd} and \gls{upt} discussed in Section \@ref(chpt2Discussion) (e.g., Figures \@ref(fig:hf78) & \@ref(fig:streams)). Moreover, many additional heat sources [e.g., shear heating and crustal plutonism, @gao2014; @reesjones2018] may contribute to forearc \gls{shf}---increasing uncertainty when inverting \gls{upt} from \gls{shf}.

Assuming low degrees of backarc extension, estimating \gls{cd} in active \glspl{sz} using Equation \@ref(eq:zCpl) with $Z_{UP}$ inverted from backarc \gls{shf} is preferable to avoid additional uncertainties stemming from seismic and volcanic activity in the forearc. However, while $\Phi$ is inventoried for most active \glspl{sz} [@syracuse2006], a corresponding dataset of $Z_{UP}$ does not exist. Several geophysical and petrologic methods might be considered for independent estimates of $Z_{UP}$ (e.g., seismic velocities, flexure, heat flow, mantle xenoliths). Backarc \gls{shf} is still a good choice, however, because of its direct correspondence with $Z_{UP}$. For example, $Z_{UP}$ may be estimated using simple one-dimensional heat transport models assuming values for radiogenic heat production in the crust [@rudnick1998]. Special attention must be paid to crustal processes, including extension and magmatism, because additional heating will underestimate $Z_{UP}$ and, consequently, underestimate \gls{cd}.

All experiments are plotted on the same scale and location within the model domain. The flow of warm mantle is restricted to below the 1100$^{\\circ}C$ isotherm, which corresponds to the base of the upper-plate lithosphere ($Z_{UP}$). A minimum coupling depth ($Z_{cpl}$) appears to exist as models with extremely thin lithospheres (a) exhibit coupling at $\\sim$ 70-80 $km$ depth. $Z_{cpl}$ generally increases with increasing $Z_{UP}$ as mantle flow and advective heat transport are restricted to greater depths.', fig.scap='Visualizing mantle flow and coupling by upper-plate thickness'}

### Globally similar coupling depths?

A $Z_{cpl}$ distribution of 82 $\pm$ 14 $km$ (2$\sigma$) estimated for active \glspl{sz} in this study (Figure \@ref(fig:multiv)d) roughly match the preferred $Z_{cpl}$ inferred from forearc \gls{shf} for Cascadia and NE Japan [75-80 $km$, @syracuse2010; @wada2009] $km$. The range of $Z_{cpl}$ estimated for active \glspl{sz} in this study (Figure \@ref(fig:multiv)d) is relatively broad, however. For example, omitting Mexico and Nankai because their $\Phi$ values fall outside our modeling domain, estimated \glspl{cd} range from almost 100 $km$ (Kyushu) to approximately 65 $km$ (Sumatra and NE Japan, Table \@ref(tab:segs)).

\gls{cd} in active \glspl{sz} are commonly assumed to be narrowly distributed around 70-80 $km$ [@wada2009; @syracuse2010]. The strong correlation between $Z_{UP}$ and $Z_{cpl}$ found from numerical experiments imply uniform \glspl{cd} are possible if \gls{upt} are globally uniform. The \gls{shf} dataset compiled by @wada2009 (Table \@ref(tab:segs)) shows average backarc \gls{shf} are indeed similar among active \glspl{sz}---implying a narrow distribution of \glspl{cd} (Figure \@ref(fig:multiv)d). Much of their dataset is based on @currie2006, who estimate \gls{upt} for 10 circum-Pacific subduction zones of 50-60 $km$ (defined by the 1200 $^{\circ}C$ isotherm). Uniformly thin \gls{upt} are corroborated by uniformly high heat flow ($>$ 70 $mW/m^{2}$), thermobarometric constraints on mantle xenoliths, and P-wave velocities [@currie2006]. An attempt is made to further corroborate the uniformity of \gls{upt} in Chapter \@ref(chpt3) by interpolating \gls{shf} near active \glspl{sz}.

Although it still curious why upper-plates among \glspl{sz} may have similar thicknesses, one can assume it is likely related to some processes of lithospheric erosion proposed for subarc lithosphere. These include: lithospheric delamination induced by lower crust eclogitization [@sobolev2005], small-scale convection caused by hydration-induced mantle wedge weakening [@arcay2006], thermal erosion [@england2010], mechanical weakening by percolating melts [@gerya2011], and subarc foundering of magmatic cumulates [@jull2001]. Most of these mechanisms are thus strongly related to mantle wedge hydration, melting, and melt transport toward volcanic arcs.

The metamorphic rock record may also imply consistency among \glspl{cd} in \glspl{sz}. For example, the demise of a serpentine channel and onset of coupling may provide a natural barrier such that rocks are more likely to be exhumed from within the channel than from below it. The relative abundance of blueschists and eclogites should then be greater for pressures below estimated \glspl{cd} (approximately 2.4 $GPa$ or 70-80 $km$) than above them. This hypothesis will be explicitly explored in Chapter \@ref(chpt4). 

## Conclusions

Three important results are highlighted in this study:

1. \gls{cd} is stabilized near the base of the upper-plate lithosphere by competing dynamic feedbacks regulating heat transport, serpentine dehydration, and mechanical coupling in the upper-plate mantle.

2. A simple expression fitted to \glspl{cd} observed in numerical experiments allows the \glspl{cd} to be estimated for active \glspl{sz} by inverting \gls{upt} from \gls{shf}.

3. Uniform \gls{shf} in circum-Pacific subduction zones [@currie2006; @wada2009] may indicate uniform \glspl{cd} at approximately 80 $km$.

Questions remain, however, including: how do warm (thin) upper-plates persist over 100's of kilometers behind arcs and throughout the lifespan of subduction zones? How abruptly are dehydration reaction occurring along the subduction interface? How can expressions like Equation \@ref(eq:zCpl) be improved using natural datasets? Each of these questions may be good candidates for future research.

## Abstract {#chpt3Abstract}

Heat fluxing through the Earth's surface provides indirect observations of \glsfirst{pts} fields deep in \glspl{sz}. Global heat flow databases, therefore, are invaluable for generating and testing hypotheses about \gls{sz} geodynamics. However, evaluating spatial variability of \glsfirst{shf} across large tectonic features requires careful projection and interpolation of sparse observations. This study investigates the accuracy and resolution of simple ordinary Kriging methods applied to \gls{shf} near \gls{sz} segments. Kriging interpolations, based on the First Law of Geography (spatial continuity), are directly compared to an approach based on the Third Law of Geography (Similarity). Both methods are generally comparable and show diverse spatial patterns of (dis)continuous \gls{shf} near \glspl{sz}. Diverse spatial patterns of \gls{shf} may imply spatially heterogeneous lithospheric thickness (contrary to expectations from Chapter \@ref(chpt2)), spatially heterogeneous dynamics, spatially heterogeneous near-surface perturbations, and/or undersampling relative to the scale and magnitude of spatial variability. The results highlight present challenges in inferring \gls{sz} geodynamics from \gls{shf} datasets and encourage cautious interpretation after characterizing \gls{shf} patterns to the fullest extent possible. Dataset scaling and developing new composite interpolation schema will improve interpolation resolution and accuracy, promising better tools for distinguishing geodynamic variability among active \glspl{sz}.

## Introduction {#chpt3Intro}

Heat escaping the solid Earth's surface indicates a dynamically cooling planet. Surface heat flow databases [@pollack1993; @hasterok2008; @lucazeau2019; @jennings2021] enable geodynamic investigations by relating the amount of heat escaping Earth's surface to heat-transferring and heat-generating subsurface processes like hydrothermal circulation, radioactive decay, fault motion, subduction dynamics, and mantle convection [@fourier1827; @kelvin1863; @parsons1977; @pollack1977; @stein1992; @hasterok2013; @stein1994; @rudnick1998; @furlong2013; @gao2014; @furukawa1993; @wada2009; @kerswell2020; @currie2004; @currie2006]. \Glsfirst{shf} observations have motivated research in many scientific and industrial fields as evident by more than 1,393 publications compiled in the largest and most recent \gls{shf} database [`ThermoGlobe`, @jennings2021; @lucazeau2019].

While `ThermoGlobe` currently contains `r format(nrow(hf), big.mark = ',')` observations, the irregularly-spaced data only cover a small fraction of the Earth's surface [510,065,800 $km^2$, @archinal2018] with an average spatial density of only `r format(nrow(hf)/510065800*1e6, digits = 3)` $obs/M\,km^2$. Estimating global or regional \gls{shf} rates thus requires careful interpolation of sparse observations across relatively large distances, even in the most densely sampled regions. Previous work approaches this problem by integrating geographic, geologic, geochronologic, and geophysical information into interpolation methods. Estimates for unknown target locations are selected from a \gls{shf} distributions constructed from global observation sites that have similar characteristics [e.g. sites have similar bathymetry, elevation, proximity to active or ancient orogens, seafloor age, upper mantle shear wave velocities, etc., @chapman1975; @lee1965; @sclater1970; @davies2013; @shapiro2004; @goutorbe2011; @lucazeau2019]. These methods are called *Similarity* methods (Figure \@ref(fig:similarityBuffer)) and follow assumptions embedded in the Third Law of Geography: *the more similar the geographic configuration of two points, the more similar their values* [@zhu2018]. Global scale problems are particularly suited for this approach as it does not rely on the spatial density of observations. On the other hand, assumed interactions among many independent geologic proxies used to construct \gls{shf} distributions, each with its own assumptions and uncertainties, makes Similarity a complex combinatorial problem vulnerable to decisions about the number of proxies, proxy dataset quality, and simplified geologic models used to compute observable classes [see @goutorbe2011 for method details].

```

Similarity methods generally ignore any notion of spatial dependence, or continuity, of \gls{shf}. Measures of proximity to orogens and active volcanic areas may be considered in Similarity methods [@goutorbe2011; @lucazeau2019], but these measures roughly reference spatial dependence to tectonic features and not to other nearby \gls{shf} observations. Generally speaking, spatial (dis)continuity of \gls{shf} reflects the (dis)continuity of subsurface geodynamics (assuming insignificant near-surface perturbations). For example, broad low-\gls{shf} regions on continents outline cratons and uniform \gls{shf} near \glspl{sz} are interpreted to reflect uniform lithospheric thickness [@currie2004; @currie2006; @hyndman2005] and mechanical coupling depths [@furukawa1993; @wada2009; @kerswell2020]. This phenomenon is encapsulated in the First Law of Geography: *everything is related, but nearer things are more related* [@krige1951; @matheron1963]. It is crucial for regional geodynamic investigations to characterize the spatial continuity of \gls{shf} observations whenever possible.

In contrast to Similarity methods, ordinary Kriging [@krige1951] approaches interpolation by only considering the locations of nearby observations and their values. Kriging conserves spatial dependence and ideally presents the *on-the-ground* reality given enough observations. However, accurate Kriging interpolations are challenging in geodynamically diverse settings because the method assumes second order weak stationarity (the relationship among \gls{shf} observations is constant and only depends on the distance between points), which is likely violated in regions encompassing many interacting tectonic features. However, stationarity need only apply over the local Kriging domain, so this problem is overcome by careful choice of Kriging parameters. Although not applied in this study, modifications to Kriging may be considered, including relaxing assumptions of stationarity or applying techniques that respect the Second Law of Geography [*spatial phenomena are inherently heterogeneous*, @goodchild2004], such as directional Kriging or Markov-Bayes techniques [@bardossy1997].

This Chapter focuses on evaluating the accuracy, resolution, and diversity of \gls{shf} interpolations near 13 active \glspl{sz} produced by Similarity and Kriging methods. The following questions are considered: 1) At what resolution can spatial \gls{shf} patterns be confidently resolved with the current global database? 2) Are Kriging and Similarity methods comparable when applied to \gls{shf} near \glspl{sz}? 3) What do the differences (if any) imply about geodynamic variability among active \glspl{sz}, especially with respect to uniform upper-plate thickness discussed in Chapter \@ref(chpt2)?

First, ordinary Kriging is applied to the `ThermoGlobe` database [@lucazeau2019; @jennings2021] cropped within 1000 $km$ buffers around 13 active \glspl{sz} defined by @syracuse2006. Kriging estimates and uncertainties are then directly compared (point-by-point) to Similarity interpolations from @lucazeau2019. The results show Kriging and Similarity methods are generally comparable for most subduction segments but Similarity estimates have considerably less error. This study highlights present challenges in inferring \gls{sz} geodynamics quantitatively from \gls{shf} datasets and encourages cautious interpretation after characterizing \gls{shf} patterns to the fullest extent possible. Scaling datasets and developing composite interpolation schema promise better tools for distinguishing geodynamic variability near active \glspl{sz}.

## Methods

### The `ThermoGlobe` database

The `ThermoGlobe` database is available from the supplementary material of @lucazeau2019 and is accessible online at \url{http://heatflow.org} [@jennings2021]. It currently contains `r format(nrow(hf), big.mark=',')` data points, their locations in latitude/longitude, and important metadata---including a data quality rank (`Code 6`) from A (high-quality) to D (low-quality). The reader is referred to @lucazeau2019 and \url{http://heatflow.org} for details on compilation, references, historical perspective on `ThermoGlobe`, and previous compilations. `ThermoGlobe` is the most recent database available, has been carefully compiled, and is open-access.

Like @lucazeau2019, `r format(sum(hf$code6 == 'D', na.rm = T), big.mark = ',')` poor quality observations (`Code 6` = D), `r sum(is.na(hf['hf']), na.rm = T)` data points without heat flow observations, and `r sum(is.na(hf$longitude), na.rm = T)+sum(is.na(hf$latitude), na.rm = T)` without geographic information are excluded from the analysis. Note that quality control of such a large dataset is an ongoing endeavor and `r format(sum(hf$code6=='Z', na.rm = T), big.mark=',')` observations currently have an undetermined quality (`Code 6` = Z). Duplicate observations at the same location are parsed (to avoid singular covariance matrices during Kriging) by selecting only the best quality measurement. If duplicate measurements are of equal quality, one is randomly chosen. Finally, only \gls{shf} values in the range (0 - 250] $mWm^{-2}$ are included in Kriging. \gls{shf} observations outside of the range (0 - 250] $mWm^{-2}$ are considered anomalous [e.g. collected near geothermal systems, @lucazeau2019] and constitute a small fraction of measurements (`r format(nrow(hf[hf$hf < 0 | hf$hf > 250,]), big.mark = ',')` out of `r format(nrow(hf[hf$hf > 0 & hf$hf <= 250,]), big.mark = ',')`) forming long tails on either side of \gls{shf} distributions. The final dataset used for Kriging contains `r format(nrow(hf.crop), big.mark=',')` observations after filtering for quality, missing values, and heat flow range, parsing `r format(n.dup,big.mark=',')` duplicate pairs, and cropping within \gls{sz} buffers (Table \@ref(tab:hfSummaryTable) & Figure \@ref(fig:hfSummaryPlot)).

Heat flow distributions are centered between `r min(hf.summary$median)` and `r max(hf.summary$median)` $mWm^{-2}$ and highly skewed right. Skewness represents near-surface perturbations from geothermal systems and tectonic regions with high thermal activity. Diverse interactions between tectonic and near-surface processes are apparent from the broad, irregular \gls{shf} distributions. Distributions are colored by quantiles (25%, 50%, 75%).

### Map projection and interpolation grid

`ThermoGlobe` data and Similarity interpolations from @lucazeau2019 are transformed into a Pacific-centered Robinson \gls{crs} defined using the `proj4` string "`+proj=robin +lon_0=-155 +lon_wrap=-155 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs`" [@proj2021]. All geographic operations, including transformation, cropping, Kriging, and comparing interpolations, are performed in the above \gls{crs} using general-purpose functions in the `R` package `sf` [@pebesma2018]. The Kriging domains (Figure \@ref(fig:domainConstruct)) are defined by drawing 1000 $km$ circular buffers around each \gls{sz} segment defined by @syracuse2006. Target locations for Kriging are defined across the same grid used by @lucazeau2019 to compute point-by-point differences with their Similarity interpolation.

(ref:domainConstructCap) Example of a interpolation domain constructed around Kyushu Ryukyu. Interpolation domains are defined by drawing a 1000 $km$ circular buffer (thin black line) around the segment boundary (bold black line). `ThermoGlobe` data is cropped within the buffered region by intersection (left). Note that Kyushu Ryukyu is one of the most densely sampled regions, yet still has considerable gaps. Similarity interpolation (right) fills in the gaps and presents a textured distribution by combining many underlying geologic proxy datasets. \gls{shf} above 250 $mWm^{-2}$ is colored white.

### Kriging

Kriging is derived from the theory of *regionalized variables* [@matheron1963; @matheron2019], which formally defines a probabilistic framework for spatial interpolation of natural phenomena. In simple terms, Kriging approximates an unknown quantity as a linear combination of all nearby known quantities. Kriging is a three-step process that involves: 1) estimating an experimental variogram $\hat{\gamma}(h)$ which characterizes the spatial (dis)continuity of some quantity within the Kriging domain, 2) fitting one of many variogram models $\gamma(h)$ to the experimental variogram, and 3) directly solving a linear system of Kriging equations to estimate unknown quantities at arbitrary target locations [@krige1951; @cressie2015]. The general-purpose functions defined in the `R` package `gstat` [@graler2016; @pebesma2004] are used to perform all three Kriging steps. The first step is computing experimental variograms as defined by @bardossy1997:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    &\hat{\gamma}(h) = \frac{1}{2N(h)}\sum_{N(h)}^{}[Z(u_i) - Z(u_j)]^2 \\
    &N(h) = \#\{h \  \in \  [h - \delta,\  h + \delta)\} \\
    &h = |u_i - u_j| \\
    &\delta = \frac{\max(h)}{n\ c}
  \end{aligned}
  (\#eq:variogram)
\end{equation}

where $Z(u_i)$ and $Z(u_j)$ are pairs of observations located at $u_i$ and $u_j$, $N(h)$ is the number of point-pairs separated by a lag distance, $h$, and $\delta$ is a binwidth used to evaluate $\hat{\gamma}(h)$ with irregularly spaced data. The binwidth is defined by computing the maximum lag distance among all point-pairs $\max(h)$ divided by the number of lags $n$ and a lag cutoff proportionality constant $c$. The binwidth $\delta$ is then multiplied by the sum of the number of lags $n$ and a horizontal lag shift constant $l$ to effectively shift $\hat{\gamma}(h)$ to the left proportionally to $l$. This is necessary to avoid negative ranges when fitting experimental variograms with anomalously high variances at small lag distances.

This study applies ordinary Kriging with isotropic variogram models to \gls{shf} data projected onto a smooth sphere (neglecting elevation). Kriging is applied locally across larger domains (to avoid violating stationarity assumptions) by evaluating only the nearest $n_{max}$ point-pairs at each target location. Several variogram parameters influence the Kriging result, including the choice of variogram model, the scope of local Kriging $n_{max}$, and choice of experimental variogram parameters in Equation \@ref(eq:variogram). A constrained non-linear optimization approach is used to find optimum values for the parameters $\Theta = \{model,\ n,\ c,\ n_{max},\ l\}$. A weighted sum of \glspl{rmse} evaluated during variogram model fitting and Kriging is used as a cost function $C(\Theta) = w_{vgrm}\ C_{vgrm}(\Theta) + w_{interp}\ C_{interp}(\Theta)$ to simultaneously minimize variogram and Kriging errors [after @li2018]. The `R` package `nloptr` is used to optimize the cost function $C(\Theta)$. A full description of the Kriging system of equations, underlying assumptions, and optimization methods is presented in Appendix \@ref(krigeOpt).

```

### Kriging parameters

Optimized Kriging parameters, cross-validation errors, and associated cost are given in Table \@ref(tab:vgrmSummaryTable) and Figure \@ref(fig:vgrmSummaryPlot) (see Appendix \@ref(krigeOpt) for details about the optimization procedure). Kriging parameters vary substantially from segment to segment but do not correlate with cost (with the possible exception of the variogram sill, Figure \@ref(fig:vgrmSummaryPlot)). Despite a range of domain sizes, observation densities, and diverse tectonic configurations, all Kriging domains converge on solutions within 15-20 iterations (Figure \@ref(fig:optTrace)) without noticeable patterns of error overall (Figure \@ref(fig:vgrmSummaryPlot)). Differences in cost are apparently explained by constant segment-to-segment differences in \gls{shf} distributions ($\sigma_{vgrm}$, $\sigma_{interp}$, Equation \@ref(eq:costExp)) rather than differences in Kriging parameters. The variogram optimization methods are thus successfully generalizable across \gls{sz} segments without a need for case-by-case data manipulation or anisotropic variogram models.

```{r vgrmSummaryTable}
v.opt %>%
mutate(
  'cutoff.prop' = round(cutoff.prop, 1),
  'n.lags' = round(n.lags, 1),
  'lag.start' = round(lag.start, 1),
  'n.max' = round(n.max, 1),
  'sill' = round(sill),
  'range' = round(range/1000),
  'cv.rmse' = round(cv.rmse),
  'cost' = round(cost, 3)
) %>% 
kable(
  col.names = c('Segment', 'Model', 'Cutoff', 'Lags', 'Shift', '$n_{max}$', 'Sill', 'Range', 'RMSE', 'Cost'),
  caption = 'Optimum variogram models by segment',
  escape = F,
  booktabs = T,
  format = 'latex'
) %>%
kable_styling(latex_options = c('striped', 'scale_down')) %>%

footnote(
  general_title = '',
  general = c('\\\\uline{\\\\textit{note}}: Optimum model selected by minimum cost (excluding Gau models)', '\\\\uline{\\\\textit{key}}: $n_{max}$: max point-pairs for local Kriging, Sill $[(mWm^{-2})^2]$, Range $[km]$, RMSE: Krige cross-validation error $[mWm^{-2}]$, Cost $[mWm^{-2}]$'),
  threeparttable = T,
  escape = F
)
```

Kriging cross-validation errors are within `r round(min(v.opt$cv.rmse)-7)` (`r v.opt$segment[which.min(v.opt$cv.rmse)]`) to `r round(max(v.opt$cv.rmse)-7)` (`r v.opt$segment[which.max(v.opt$cv.rmse)]`) $mWm^{-2}$ of the quoted 7 $mWm^{-2}$ \gls{rmse} for @lucazeau2019's preferred Similarity model (7 proxy observables, Table \@ref(tab:vgrmSummaryTable)). As expected, Kriging errors can be relatively small compared to Similarity for domains with high observation density (`r v.opt$segment[which.min(v.opt$cv.rmse)]`; n = `r format(nrow(shp.hf.crop[[v.opt$segment[which.min(v.opt$cv.rmse)]]]), big.mark = ',')`) but relatively large where observational density is comparatively low (`r v.opt$segment[which.max(v.opt$cv.rmse)]`; n = `r format(nrow(shp.hf.crop[[v.opt$segment[which.max(v.opt$cv.rmse)]]]), big.mark = ',')`). Please note, however, that Kriging error is evaluated only on observations within 1000 $km$ buffers of \gls{sz} segments. The quoted 7 $mWm^{-2}$ \gls{rmse} from @lucazeau2019 evaluates averaged differences among global \gls{shf} observations and Similarity estimates across all oceans and continents. Differentiating \glspl{rmse} in Table \@ref(tab:vgrmSummaryTable) from errors reported by @lucazeau2019 [or other global interpolations: e.g., @goutorbe2011; @pollack1993; @shapiro2004] are, therefore, only rough comparisons. It is unclear how Similarity uncertainty will scale overall when the domain is restricted to the regional tectonic scale.

```

Two point-by-point comparisons between Similarity and Kriging methods are presented in this study---*estimates* and *uncertainties*. Summary statistics for *estimate* differences are given in Table \@ref(tab:diffSummaryTable). Summary statistics for *uncertainty* differences are given in Appendix \@ref(interpDiffAppendix).

```{r diffSummaryTable}
interp.diff %>%
kable(
  col.names = c('Segment', 'Model', 'Min', 'Max', 'Median', 'IQR', 'Mean', '$\\sigma$', 'n', 'Cost'),
  caption = '[Similarity $-$ Krige] estimate differences by segment',
  escape = F,

  threeparttable = T,
  escape = F
)
```

Differences between Similarity and Kriging estimates are centered near zero with median differences ranging from `r min(interp.diff$median)` to `r max(interp.diff$median)` $mWm^{-2}$, but broadly distributed with interquartile ranges from `r min(interp.diff$IQR)` to `r max(interp.diff$IQR)` $mWm^{-2}$ and long tails extending from `r min(interp.diff$min)` to `r max(interp.diff$max)` $mWm^{-2}$. Interpolation methods generally agree to within a few tens of $mWm^{-2}$ on average (Figure \@ref(fig:diffSummaryPlot)). Distributions of estimate differences are either approximately symmetrical, or skewed right. Right skew and a tendency of medians to deviate positively from zero indicate a systematic overestimation of \gls{shf} by the Similarity method compared to Kriging (Figure \@ref(fig:diffSummaryPlot)). The exception is Tonga New Zealand which has a slight negative median. Please note, however, that Kriging is applied to observations within the range (0 - 250] $mWm^{-2}$, whereas Similarity uses the entire `ThermoGlobe` dataset (filtered for quality). While this may explain some of the long positive tails in Figure \@ref(fig:diffSummaryPlot), it does not significantly affect the overall distributions of estimate differences as relatively few `ThermoGlobe` observations fall outside of (0 - 250] $mWm^{-2}$ (`r format(nrow(hf[hf$hf < 0 | hf$hf > 250,]), big.mark = ',')` out of `r format(nrow(hf[hf$hf > 0 & hf$hf <= 250,]), big.mark = ',')`).

The broad distributions of estimate differences likely arise from contrasting assumptions underlying either interpolation method. Kriging tends to spatially smooth out \gls{shf} gradients, whereas Similarity is agnostic to gradients and may present very textured interpolations. Comparison between Krige and Similarity interpolations may appear similar across the interpolation domain on average, but with subtle differences at the grid-step scale. The broadest distributions (e.g. `r interp.diff$segment[which.max(interp.diff$IQR)]`), however, point to less subtle differences between methods (examples given in Section \@ref(regionalDiff)).

(ref:diffSummaryPlotCap) Summary of differences between Similarity and Kriging estimates. Note that differences are computed as [Similarity $-$ Krige]. Differences are centered near zero with medians ranging from `r min(interp.diff$median)` to `r max(interp.diff$median)` $mWm^{-2}$, but broadly distributed with interquartile ranges from `r min(interp.diff$IQR)` to `r max(interp.diff$IQR)` $mWm^{-2}$ and long tails extending from `r min(interp.diff$min)` to `r max(interp.diff$max)` $mWm^{-2}$. Interpolation methods generally agree to within a few tens of $mWm^{-2}$ near \gls{sz} segments. Positive medians and right skew indicate systematic overestimation of \gls{shf} by Similarity compared to Kriging. The broadest distributions (Andes and Central America) reflect less subtle differences between methods. Distributions are colored by quantiles (25%, 50%, 75%). Similarity estimates from @lucazeau2019. Please refer to Figure \@ref(fig:sigmaDiffSummaryPlot) for uncertainty differences.

### Regional interpolation differences {#regionalDiff}

Notable sources of differences between Similarity and Kriging methods include 1) tectonic features resolved by Similarity that are smoothed-out from Kriging or 2) general discordance between the spatial continuity of \gls{shf} observations and Similarity estimates. Examples given in this section highlight the range of differences observed between Similarity and Kriging methods in diverse interpolation domains. These include complex tectonic environments (Central America, Vanuatu), simple tectonic environments (Kyushyu Ryukyu), and regions with very few observations (Scotia). All other segments are in Appendix \@ref(interpDiffAppendix).

For example, high \gls{shf} representing the arms of the GalÃ¡pagos triple junction are resolved by Similarity to the SW of the Central America segment (Figure \@ref(fig:centralAmericaDiff)). However, the triple junction arms are not well defined by Kriging. The interpolation comparison for Central America highlights two distinct regions---bright positive differences along the arms of the triple junction and within the subducting Cocos Plate, and muted differences to the E and NE of the Cocos Plate behind the volcanic arc. Note the moderate differences within the Cocos Plate in Figure \@ref(fig:centralAmericaDiff) where Similarity estimates relatively high \gls{shf} by proximity to the nearby spreading centers. Kriging estimates in the same region disagree because \gls{shf} observations within the Cocos Plate are, in fact, relatively low. Similar discordance between high Similarity estimates and low \gls{shf} observations are observed in many subduction zone segments, especially near spreading centers.

In contrast, estimate and uncertainty differences between Similarity and Kriging are small and narrowly distributed near Kyushu Ryukyu (median difference: `r interp.diff$median[interp.diff$segment == 'Kyushu Ryukyu']`, IQR: `r interp.diff$IQR[interp.diff$segment == 'Kyushu Ryukyu']` $mWm^{-2}$) compared to Central America (median difference: `r interp.diff$median[interp.diff$segment == 'Central America']`, IQR: `r interp.diff$IQR[interp.diff$segment == 'Central America']` $mWm^{-2}$). Kyushyu Ryukyu has has a comparable number of observations (n = `r format(nrow(shp.hf.crop[['Kyushu Ryukyu']]), big.mark = ',')`) as Central America (n = `r format(nrow(shp.hf.crop[['Central America']]), big.mark = ',')`), but a simpler tectonic configuration (no spreading centers) and more regularly spaced observations. Kriging near Kyushu Ryukyu resolves much of the texture seen in the Similarity interpolation (Figure \@ref(fig:kyushuRyukyuDiff)). Similarity and Kriging evidently converge in this case by a combination of adequate observation density and spatial coverage. However, it is nontrivial to suggest minimum thresholds constituting "adequate" observation density or spatial coverage. General guidelines may be developed, but Kriging results must still be evaluated *a posteriori*.

The Scotia segment illustrates a case where \gls{shf} observations are incredibly sparse. Similarity resolves the East Scotia Ridge (ESR) and the WSW-ENE trending transform boundary separating the Scotia and Sandwich Plates from the Antartic Plate (Figure \@ref(fig:scotiaDiff)). Kriging, on the other hand, appears featureless because very few \gls{shf} observations (n = `r nrow(shp.hf.crop[['Scotia']])`) poorly define experimental variograms. Kriging estimates thus approximate the expected (mean: `r hf.summary$mean[hf.summary$segment == 'Scotia']` $mWm^{-2}$) value for the entire domain according to Equation \@ref(eq:linEstimate). That is, Kriging provides no more geodynamic information than computing the arithmetic mean heat flow for binned observations within 1000 $km$ of the Scotia segment. Resolving spatial (dis)continuity is unfeasible and Similarity methods become the obvious choice in such cases.

While Similarity tends to define tectonic features and Kriging tends to smooth out tectonic features, the opposite pattern is observed within the tectonically-complex region near Vanuatu. Similarity resolves the N-S trending spreading center separating the New Hebrides plate from the Balmoral Reef and Conway Reef microplates (Figure \@ref(fig:vanuatuDiff)). However, \gls{shf} observations are sufficiently dense and continuous to partially resolve the short ridge segments and transform faults outlining the microplates between Vanuatu and the Tonga New Zealand segments by Kriging. The differences are difficult to interpret because of the somewhat random discordance between interpolation methods.

(ref:centralAmericaDiffCap) Similarity vs. Kriging estimates and uncertainties for Central America. Arms of the GalÃ¡pagos triple junction (GTJ), the East Pacific Rise (EPR) and Cocos Ridge (CR), are resolved by Similarity (topleft), but smoothed-out by Kriging (topright). Note the moderate positive differences between estimates within the Cocos Plate (CP) where Similarity estimates relatively high \gls{shf}, but \gls{shf} observations are low (bottomleft). Patterns in uncertainty differences generally reflect observation density. Note that computed differences off the colorbar scale in the bottom plots are colored grey.

## Discussion

### Interpolation approaches

The two interpolation approaches compared in this Chapter are fundamentally based on different underlying assumptions encapsulated by the First and Third Laws of Geography. Kriging is based on the First Law: *everything is related, but nearer things are more related* [@krige1951]. Similarity is based on the Third Law: *two points with similar geographic configurations should have similar values* [@zhu2018]. The comparisons in Section \@ref(chpt3Results) provide new context for researchers interested in using \gls{shf} to investigate \gls{sz} geodynamics. While one approach is not evidently favourable in principle, Similarity produces more accurate interpolations in practice (at the scale and scope of active \glspl{sz}), especially in cases with low observation density and irregularly-spacing.

Similarity generally produces interpolations that resolve discrete tectonic features (spreading centers and large fault systems) with detailed regional texture (see Appendix \@ref(interpDiffAppendix)). The texture is artificial insofar as it does not represent actual spatial changes in \gls{shf}, but appears to be geodynamically consistent across all 13 active \gls{sz} considered in this study. The success of the Similarity approach comes from integration of multiple sources of geologic information---carefully compiled and combined into a composite estimate of \gls{shf}. Combining several (or dozens of) proxy datasets may be more meticulous than ordinary Kriging, yet Similarity works reliably well across all 13 active \gls{sz} segments. Kriging estimates, on the other hand, necessarily yield simple arithmetic means for \gls{sz} segments that lack sufficient observation density (e.g. Scotia, Figure \@ref(fig:scotiaDiff)). While some use cases exist for Kriging's inherent smoothing effect, geodynamically-consistent estimates of \gls{shf} near \glspl{sz} are likely more desirable in most cases.

Two inconsistencies with the Similarity approach are noted, however. First, Similarity systematically overestimates \gls{shf} compared to Kriging (Figure \@ref(fig:diffSummaryPlot)). This may be partially explained by the restricted range ((0 - 250] $mWm^{-2}$) of `ThermoGlobe` observations used for Kriging. Or it may represent skewed distributions or overweighting of some proxies used in the Similarity interpolation method (e.g. proximity to spreading centers, Figure \@ref(fig:centralAmericaDiff)). Second, known features within the tectonically-complex region near Vanuatu may be better resolved by Kriging than Similarity. It is important to note, however, that Vanuatu is the only case where Kriging resolves tectonic features that Similarity does not; the trend is otherwise opposite. Moreover, the inconsistencies near Vanuatu do not imply algorithmic issues with Similarity and can likely be resolved by using a finer-scale grid.

The most important inconsistencies to evaluate, regardless of interpolation method, are general discordance between estimates and observations (e.g. \gls{rmse}). Disagreements with observations imply failures of the underlying Geographic Laws, which are not easily correctable algorithmically in a generalized sense. Similarity is demonstrably successful at achieving low error rates at the global-scale even when randomly combining proxies [@lucazeau2019]. Assuming error rates for Similarity interpolations constrained to regional scales (e.g. near \gls{sz} segments) are consistent with \glspl{rmse} reported by @lucazeau2019 for global scales, Similarity is on average `r round(min(v.opt$cv.rmse)/7)` to `r round(max(v.opt$cv.rmse)/7)` times more accurate than simple ordinary Kriging (compare 7 $mWm^{-2}$  Similarity \gls{rmse} to Kriging \glspl{rmse} in Table \@ref(tab:vgrmSummaryTable)). This is sound basis for presently favouring Similarity over Kriging across \gls{sz} segment scales. Exceptions may include regions with high observation density and spatial coverage, or regions that are far beneath the resolution of global proxy datasets (approximately $0.5^\circ \times 0.5^\circ$) used for Similarity [@goutorbe2011; @lucazeau2019].

Regardless of methodology, the accuracy and resolution of interpolations compared in this study are enough to probe hypotheses about regional geodynamic (in)consistencies among active \glspl{sz}. Similarity and Kriging interpolations qualitatively show diverse patterns in \gls{shf} among \gls{sz} segments. Diverse patterns in \gls{shf} may imply spatially heterogeneous lithospheric thickness (contrary to expectations from Chapter \@ref(chpt2)), spatially heterogeneous dynamics, spatially heterogeneous near-surface perturbations, and/or undersampling relative to the scale and magnitude of spatial variability. Please note, however, that spatially continuous \gls{shf} patterns also appear across \gls{sz} segments (e.g. Sumatra Banda Sea, see Appendix \@ref(interpDiffAppendix)). At present, cautious interpretations of \gls{sz} geodynamics on the basis of spatial \gls{shf} patterns are encouraged. Scaling datasets and developing composite (layering Similarity + Kriging + $\cdots$) interpolation schema promises better tools for scrutinizing differences among regional tectonic domains.

### 1D vs. 2D spatial variability

Testing hypotheses relating to \gls{sz} geodynamics requires careful sampling of \gls{shf} in order to apply statistical models. Previous studies commonly use a four-part sampling strategy: 1) draw a cross-section line perpendicular to a trench, 2) draw a rectangle with arbitrary width encompassing the section line, 3) gather all \gls{shf} observations within the rectangle, and 4) project the gathered observations onto the section line [e.g., @currie2004; @currie2006; @hyndman2005; @wada2009]. This sampling strategy is simple and effective if measurements along section lines are equally spaced with high spatial density. However, the strategy has two major limitations. First, the First Law of Geography is increasingly violated with the size of the sampling rectangle as more disparate points are projected onto the section line for comparison. Second, transects characterize \gls{shf} patterns within a narrow scope, and do not consider spatial variability in 2D (along strike in map view).

Hypotheses such as uniformly thin upper-plate lithospheres (Chapter \@ref(chpt2)) and depths of plate coupling among \glspl{sz} [@currie2004; @currie2006; @furukawa1993; @kerswell2020; @wada2009] are inferred from 1D sampling strategies like the one described above. However, the true extent of such characterizations of \gls{sz} geodynamics is yet to be evaluated in 2D. Similarity and Kriging interpolations in Section \@ref(chpt3Results) show spatial variability in \gls{shf} that appear to contradict such claims of uniformity within, or among, \gls{sz} segments. Insofar as \gls{shf} can answer questions about \gls{sz} geodynamics, claims of broad uniformity among active \glspl{sz} are better qualified with observations that characterize the spatial variability of \gls{shf} to the fullest extent possible. For example, testing the hypothesis that upper-plate lithospheres are uniformly thin requires rejecting the null hypothesis that upper-plate thicknesses are different. This can be done quantitatively, in 2D, using either Similarity or Kriging interpolations compared in this study. 

## Conclusions

This study uses ordinary Kriging to interpolate global \gls{shf} observations sampled within 1000 $km$ buffers of 13 active \gls{sz} segments. Kriging interpolations are directly compared to Similarity interpolations within the same domains to evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of each technique in distinguishing spatial patterns of \gls{shf} near \glspl{sz}. Differences between interpolation estimates and uncertainties highlight four important points of consideration:

1. Similarity and Kriging methods produce broadly comparable results, but Similarity interpolations are favoured for their lower error rates and geodynamically-consistent results across all 13 \gls{sz} segments
2. Interpolations show diverse 2D spatial patterns of (dis)continuous \gls{shf}, encouraging cautious interpretations of subsurface geodynamics without characterizing \gls{shf} distributions to the fullest extent possible
3. Dataset scaling and composite interpolation schema will unequivocally provide better tools for evaluating geodynamic diversity within, and among, \gls{sz} segments and is proposed for future research

## Abstract {#chpt4Abstract}

\Glsfirst{hp} metamorphic rocks that are detached from subducting oceanic-plates and exhumed to the Earth's surface become invaluable records of \glsfirst{pts} fields and chemical fluxes deep in \glspl{sz}. For example, comparing maximum metamorphic \glsfirst{ptt} estimates from suites of \gls{hp} rocks allows evaluation of \gls{pt} gradients along the plate interface. However, some incongruent interpretations concerning \gls{pt} gradients, recovery rates, and recovery depths arise when comparing globally aggregated \gls{ptt} estimates with \gls{pt} gradients from numerical geodynamic models. This study combines two numerical methods (machine learning + numerical geodynamic modelling) to aggregate synthetic metamorphic \gls{ptt} distributions across a range of initial \glsfirst{tkbc} for oceanic-continental convergence. The new synthetic metamorphic \gls{ptt} dataset, containing over one-million estimates, is used to address the following questions. How do recovery rates vary among \glspl{sz}? Are rocks recovered uniformly across pressures (depths)? First, Lagrangian markers are traced from 64 simulated \glspl{sz} and marker detachment from the subducting plate (recovery) is recognized by implementing a soft clustering classification algorithm. Synthetic metamorphic \gls{ptt} distributions show sensitivity to oceanic-plate age, convergence velocity, and relative detachment timing, but not to upper-plate lithospheric thickness. Four geodynamic regimes with different recovery modes are recognized and discussed with implications for interpreting the metamorphic rock record. This study stresses the importance of interpreting the rock record in terms of probability distributions in \gls{pt} space, rather than absolute \gls{pt} distributions.

## Introduction {#chpt4Intro}

Maximum metamorphic conditions, in terms of \glsfirst{pt}, have been estimated for hundreds of \glsfirst{hp} rocks exhumed from \glspl{sz} (Figure \@ref(fig:pd15)). Aggregated estimates from suites of \gls{hp} rocks, the *rock record*, are the only tangible record of \gls{pt} conditions experienced by Earth's lithosphere during deformation and chemical processing in \glspl{sz} [e.g. @agard2009; @agard2018; @penniston2015]. Together with geophysical imaging [e.g. @ferris2003; @naif2015; @hyndman2003; @syracuse2006; @rondenay2008], \glsfirst{shf} [e.g. @currie2006; @kerswell2021; @gao2014; @wada2009; @hyndman2005], and forward numerical modelling [e.g. @gerya2002; @sizova2010; @gerya2006; @gerya2008; @syracuse2010; @yamato2007; @yamato2008; @hacker2003; @peacock1990; @peacock1996; @mckenzie1969], the rock record underpins contemporary understandings of \gls{sz} geodynamics [e.g. @agard2009; @agard2018; @bebout2007].

What geodynamic information can be extracted from the rock record? Previous work comparing \gls{pt} distributions of \gls{hp} rocks with numerical geodynamic models identifies two key observations. First, the \gls{cdf} of metamorphic \gls{pt} estimates compiled by @penniston2015 (the `pd15` dataset) with respect to pressure reveals a kink around $\sim$ `r round(tail(pd15$pressure[pd15$cumulative <= 0.8], 1), 1)` $GPa$ that implies relatively uniform exhumation of oceanic material up to `r round(tail(pd15$pressure[pd15$cumulative <= 0.8], 1), 1)` $GPa$, but increasingly rare exhumation beyond `r round(tail(pd15$pressure[pd15$cumulative <= 0.8], 1), 1)` $GPa$ [Figure \@ref(fig:pd15), @agard2018; @kerswell2020]. Few eclogites are exhumed from pressures beyond `r round(tail(pd15$pressure[pd15$cumulative <= 0.8], 1), 1)` $GPa$, but have felsic compositions and typify deep subduction of continental material immediately preceding continental collision [@agard2018]. Evidence from \glsfirst{shf} observations and numerical experiments [@currie2006; @furukawa1993; @wada2009; @kerswell2020] suggest uniform depths of mechanical coupling among active \glspl{sz} near 2.3 $GPa$---consistent with a probability decrease above `r round(tail(pd15$pressure[pd15$cumulative <= 0.8], 1), 1)` $GPa$ implied from `pd15`. However, Chapter \@ref(chpt3) shows 2D interpolations of \gls{shf} do not necessarily support this hypothesis. Moreover, it is unclear if `pd15` implies a shift in the probability of *detachment* (recovery) or *exhumation* of oceanic material around`r round(tail(pd15$pressure[pd15$cumulative <= 0.8], 1), 1)` $GPa$.

Second, rocks recovered from P < 2 $GPa$ generally record higher temperatures than predicted by some numerical experiments [@penniston2015]. Potential explanations for non-overlapping \gls{pt} distributions among metamorphic \gls{pt} estimates and numerical models, including choice of \glsfirst{tkbc} for numerical experiments, differential exhumation from \glspl{sz} with higher average \gls{pt} gradients, and relative detachment timing from the subducting plate, are discussed by @penniston2015, @abers2017, @kohn2018, @agard2018, and @vankeken2019. Please note, however, that many comparisons among diverse numerical experiments and metamorphic terranes show various degrees of agreement depending on one's choice of initial \glspl{tkbc} and preferred suite of \gls{hp} rocks [@yamato2007; @yamato2008; @roda2010; @angiboust2012b; @roda2012; @burov2014; @ruh2015; @plunder2018; @roda2020; @holt2021].

(ref:pd15Cap) PT estimates from the rock record. (a) Maximum metamorphic conditions for exhumed HP rocks (black squares) roughly fall within thermal gradients from 5 $K/km$ to 20 $K/km$ (thin black lines; calculated with a lithostatic gradient of 35 $km/GPa$). PT estimates are smoothly distributed (grey contours) in both P and T dimensions. Summing the probability density along the P dimension gives the cumulative probability curve in (b). Note the shared y-axis. The probability of sampling a rock from $\leq$ any particular pressure is read directly from (b). For example, 80\% of rocks are recovered from $\leq$ `r round(tail(pd15$pressure[pd15$cumulative <= 0.8], 1), 1)` $GPa$, 92\% from $\leq$ `r round(tail(pd15$pressure[pd15$cumulative <= 0.92], 1), 1)` $GPa$, and so forth (dashed grey lines). The smooth contours (a) and change in slope at `r round(tail(pd15$pressure[pd15$cumulative <= 0.8], 1), 1)` $GPa$ (b) imply uniform recovery of greenschists and blueschists, but increasingly rare eclogite recovery from depths $\geq$ `r round(tail(pd15$pressure[pd15$cumulative <= 0.8], 1), 1)`. Data from @penniston2015.

```

Two hypotheses regarding chemical and mechanical processing of oceanic crustal material in \glspl{sz} follow from the above observations:

> 1. The probability of recovering \gls{hp} oceanic material is relatively uniform with depth up to `r round(tail(pd15$pressure[pd15$cumulative <= 0.8], 1), 1)` $GPa$ (null: recovery probability is non-uniform with depth)
>
> 2. Recovery rates of \gls{hp} oceanic material vary with \glspl{tkbc} (null: recovery rates are not different among \glspl{sz})

These hypotheses aim at important questions in \gls{sz} research. Are \gls{hp} rocks recovered broadly along the plate interface or discretely? Are \gls{hp} rocks differentially recovered from \glspl{sz} with favourable \gls{tkbc} or is recovery ubiquitous at similar rates among \glspl{sz}?

The primary obstacle in addressing such questions is an imbalance between an infinitely enumerable range of forward models and only a few, to a few dozens of, \glsfirst{ptt} estimates from any particular exhumed terrane. Confidently narrowing the scale and scope of hypotheses is infeasible without additional observational constraints. This study addresses this problem by building a synthetic \gls{ptt} dataset by applying machine learning techniques to recognize rock recovery across numerical simulations of subduction. More than one million markers are traced from 64 numerical experiments representing the range of presently active continental margins (from Chapter \@ref(chpt2)). Traced markers are classified as recovered, or lost, according to characteristics of their \gls{ptt} paths. \gls{pt} distributions of markers are strongly dependent on convergence rate, but weakly dependent on oceanic-plate age and \glsfirst{upt}. Further, recovery rates are moderately dependent on initial \gls{tkbc}, characterized by the thermal parameter $\Phi$. Finally, we identify four distinct geodynamic regimes and discuss their implications for interpreting aggregate metamorphic PT datasets like `pd15`.

### PT distributions of recovered markers







(ref:metaCap) Comparing marker PT distribution with the rock record. (a) The probability density of `r format(round(sum(marx.summary$n)), big.mark = ',')` recovered markers from all 64 \gls{sz} simulations (filled grey contours) are bimodally distributed with a high-probability peak at lower-blueschist to upper-greenschist facies and a modest probability hill in the eclogite facies. Recovered markers neither completely overlap with the rock record (`pd15`; light grey density contours) in absolute PT distribution nor in terms of probability density. For example, summing the probability density along the P dimension (b) shows blueschists being especially overrepresented in the rock record (`pd15`; grey line) between 0.8 $GPa$ and 2.4 $GPa$ compared to recovered markers (black line). Eclogites are also overrepresented in the rock record to a lesser degree.

include_graphics('assets/figs/chpt4/meta.png')

```




#### Convergence velocity effect








(ref:cvDensityCap) Marker PT distribution by convergence velocity. The probability density of recovered markers (filled grey contours) at low convergence rates (40 $km/Ma$) is distributed more smoothly and uniformly than at higher convergence rates. The rock record (`pd15`; light grey contours) is most consistent with slow convergence ($\leq$ 66 $km/Ma$) in terms of probability. Notably, `pd15` is most consistent with the highest convergence rate simulation in terms of absolute PT distribution. Yet, higher convergence rates ($\geq$ 66 $km/Ma$) lead to preferential recovery from two or three distinct regions of PT space with gaps in recovery that are inconsistent with `pd15`. There appears to be a convergence rate threshold and geodynamic shift at velocities $\leq$ 66 $km/Ma$.

```{r cvDensity, fig.cap='(ref:cvDensityCap)', fig.scap='Marker PT distribution by convergence velocity'}

include_graphics('assets/figs/chpt4/cv_density.png')

```







#### Oceanic plate age effect

(ref:ageDensityCap) Marker PT distribution by oceanic plate age. The probability density of recovered markers (filled grey contours) becomes slightly smoother, more normally distributed, and shifted towards higher pressures with increasing plate age. The differences are relatively small, however. The rock record (`pd15`; light grey contours) agrees most with older plate ages ($\geq$ 85 $Ma$). However, rocks recovered near $\sim$ 2 $GPa$ are overrepresented in `pd15`, compared to simulations, regardless of oceanic plate age. Oceanic plate age is not expected to have a large effect on the PT distribution of recovered HP rocks, except to shift the probability distribution towards higher pressures.

```{r ageDensity, fig.cap='(ref:ageDensityCap)', fig.scap='Marker PT distribution by oceanic-plate age'}

include_graphics('assets/figs/chpt4/age_density.png')

```



#### Upper plate thickness effect

(ref:zupDensityCap) Marker PT distribution by upper plate lithospheric thickness. The probability density of recovered markers (filled grey contours) becomes more uniformly distributed along lower PT gradients with increasing upper plate thickness. The rock record (`pd15`; light grey contours) is most consistent with thin upper plates ($\leq$ 62 $km$) in terms of absolute PT distribution. In terms of probability, however, thicker plates ($\geq$ 78 $km$) are more consistent with `pd15`. Regardless of upper plate thickness, few markers are recovered from pressures around 2 $GPa$ compared to the rock record. In general, upper plate thickness has a surprisingly small effect on the probability of recovered markers, especially with respect to pressure.


```{r zupDensity, fig.cap='(ref:zupDensityCap)', fig.scap='Marker PT distribution by upper-plate thickness'}

include_graphics('assets/figs/chpt4/ZUP_density.png')

```





#### Detachment timing effect






(ref:detachDensityCap) Marker PT distribution by relative detachment timing. The probability density of recovered markers (filled grey contours) is limited to shallow, high-T conditions until about one-third (0.3) of the timesteps have passed. PT distributions then progressively rotate towards cooler PT gradients while including more deeply recovered markers through time ($\geq$ 0.3). The probability of recovering markers in general diminishes as subduction continues, evident by the progressive leveling of probability density profiles beginning after one-half (0.5) of the timesteps have passed. Absolute PT distributions and probability distributions in PT space are both time-dependent.

```{r detachDensity, fig.cap='(ref:detachDensityCap)', fig.scap='Marker PT distribution by relative detachment timing'}

include_graphics('assets/figs/chpt4/detach_density.png')

```



### Recovery rates


(ref:recRateCap) Recovery rates for all 64 subduction simulations. Subduction simulations are ordered by increasing thermal parameter ($\Phi$) from left (young-thin-slow plates) to right (old-thick-fast plates) and by upper plate thickness ($Z_{UP}$) increasing from top (thin) to bottom (thick). Recovery rates are higher for low-$\Phi$ oceanic plates than for high-$\Phi$ oceanic plates. The transition from high recovery rates ($\geq$ 10 %) to low rates ($\leq$ 5 %) with respect to $\Phi$ appears gradual and continuous. A slight increase in recovery rate with increasing $Z_{UP}$ (down columns) is apparent, but this pattern is not consistent with all models. For example, models cde and cdn tend to decrease with increasing $Z_{UP}$. Light pink squares are simulations with no recovered markers. Recovery rates are evidently dependent on $\Phi$.

include_graphics('assets/figs/chpt4/rec_rate.png')

```



## Discussion {#chpt4Discussion}

### Recovery rates


### PT distributions


(ref:ecdfsCap) Cumulative probability distributions of marker `maxP` by thermo-kinematic initial conditions. Convergence velocity has the largest effect on the P distributions of recovered markers. There appears to be a geodynamic shift towards more uniform recovery across pressures under a threshold of < 66 $km/Ma$. Oceanic plate ages have a moderate effect on P distributions, with older plate ages recovering more markers from higher `maxP`. The combined effects of convergence velocity and age gives the complicated distributions with respect to the thermal parameter. Finally, upper plate thickness has surprisingly little effect on P distributions. Regardless of thermo-kinematic parameter, most simulations produce distributions that do not mimic `pd15` (jagged black line). HP rocks between $\sim$ 0.8 and 2.4 $GPa$ are overrepresented in `pd15` compared to most simulations. The exceptions are simulations with the slowest convergence velocity (40 $km/Ma$).

include_graphics('assets/figs/chpt4/ecdfs.png')

```



### Geodynamic regimes {#geodynamics}


(ref:geodynCap) Geodynamic regimes generally observed in subduction simulations (main) and their probability distributions of recovered markers (insets). Simulations with thick-rigid oceanic plates (cdh94) tend to have low subduction angles, especially at high convergence rates, and no recovery of eclogites. The other three regimes all share flexible plates, higher subduction angles, and recovery of eclogites to different extents. Slowly-converging simulations (cde62) tend to have wide low-viscosity serpentinized channels that store underplated material uniformly with depth. Simulations like cde62 are consistent with `pd15` in terms of their probability distribution of recovered markers (inset). The final two regimes (cdb78 & cda78) show deep opening of the serpentine channel. The mantle wedge completely detaches from the upper plate in several models and diapirs rise in subvertical low-viscosity channels behind the mantle wedge. Simulations with diapirs also closely resemble `pd15` in terms of probability distributions of recovered markers, with respect to pressure.

## Serpentine stability depth through time {#antDepth}

Stability of serpentine progressively increases with depth along the plate interface as the subducting oceanic plate continuously cools and hydrates the shallow upper-plate mantle. However, this phenomenon ceases after approximately 5 $Ma$ and dynamics change. From approximately 5 $Ma$ to tens of $Ma$ afterwards, the lower limit of serpentine dehydration stabilizes (Figure \@ref(fig:antDepth)). In theory, serpentine dehydration should continue to increase as long as water continues to flux from the oceanic-plate and the shallow upper-plate remains stagnant and cooling. Stability of serpentine dehydration through tens of $Ma$ is direct result of the correspondence between mechanical coupling and absence of serpentine along the plate interface. Notably, using Lagrangian frameworks to implement metamorphic reactions is an advantageous numerical feature allowing for such behaviour.

```{r antDepth, fig.cap='Serpentine stability depth at the plate interface vs. time for models cda, cdf, and cdp with $Z_{UP}$ = 46, 62, 78, and 94 $km$. Serpentine stabilization deepens for approximately 5 $Ma$ of subduction and then remains roughly constant for $\\leq$ 10 $Ma$. The exceptions are models with very thin $Z_{UP}$, which exhibit transient behavior for at least 15 $Ma$. Overall serpentine stability depth after approximately 5 $Ma$ depends on \\gls{upt}.', fig.scap='Serpentine stability depth vs. time'}

knitr::include_graphics('assets/figs/chpt2/figA1.png')

```

Numerical experiments in this chapter suggest a negative dynamic feedback regulating coupling and serpentine dehydration can help explain how similar configurations, in terms of depths to subducting plates beneath arcs [@england2004] and thin \glspl{upt} [@currie2006], may occur in \glspl{sz} with different \gls{tkbc} and subduction durations. The results indicate that \glspl{sz} quickly ($<$ 5 $Ma$) develop and stabilize quasi-permanent, generalized configurations with glspl{cd} dependent on \gls{upt}.

Notable exceptions occur in models with the thinnest \glspl{upt} ($Z_{UP}$ = 46 $km$). Rapid extension due to thin \glspl{upt} form spreading centers in the upper-plate within 5 $Ma$. Passive asthenospheric upwelling near spreading centers diverts heat from deep within the upper-plate mantle. Enough heat is apparently diverted to disrupt thermal feedbacks regulating coupling and serpentine stability near the plate interface. In principle, diversion of heat from the plate interface could lead to cooler conditions, deeper serpentine stability, and thus deeper coupling. Further testing to confirm this behaviour may artificially increase upper-plate strength in thin \gls{upt} experiments to prevent high rates of spreading.

## Regression summaries {#regSummary}

The form of the preferred quadratic regression model in Section \@ref(cdEstimators) (Figure \@ref(fig:results) & Table \@ref(tab:zcResults)) implies a lower limit to \gls{cd} of approximately 60 $km$, even for thin \gls{upt} and, presumably, under warm conditions during nascent subduction. In principle, thin \glspl{upt} could allow effective heat transfer in a flowing shallow asthenospheric mantle---hindering deep stabilization of serpentine. Olivine and pyroxene would be the stable mantle minerals, and strong, shallow coupling between plates would be expected @gerya2008. However, even the warmest numerical experiments (low-$\Phi$ & thin \gls{upt}) in Chapter \@ref(chpt2) eventually stabilize serpentine in the shallow upper-plate mantle. This is evident by increasing depth of mechanical coupling with time for the first 5 $Ma$ of subduction (Figure \@ref(fig:antDepth)).

## (De)hydration model {#deHydration}

The material properties used in our experiments are listed in Table \@ref(tab:materials) and Table \@ref(tab:melts). For details about the sedimentation and erosion, melting and extraction, and rheological models, please refer to @sizova2010. Here we discuss only the hydrodynamic model, because it is the most relevant aspect of our results.

The hydrodynamics in our models controls the timing and magnitude of mantle wedge hydration. The main sources of water delivered to the mantle are altered basaltic crust and seafloor sediments, which we assumed to contain up to 5 $wt.\% H_{2}O$. We assumed a gradual expulsion of water from pore space and through quasi-continuous dehydration reactions occurring within the slab. Water content is computed using the following equation:

\begin{equation}
  \chi_{H_{2}O} = \chi_{H_{2}O_{init}}\times\left(1-\frac{\Delta z}{150\times 10^{3}}\right)
\end{equation}

where $\chi_{H_{2}O_{init}}$ = 5 $wt.\%$ and $\Delta z$ is a marker's depth below the topographical surface.

If a rock marker dehydrates, an independent water particle is instantaneously generated at the same location with the respective $H_{2}O$ content. The new water particle is moved in accordance to the local velocity field, described by the following equation:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \vec{v}_{\text{water}} & = (\vec{v}_x,\ \vec{v}_z) \\
    \vec{v}_z & = \vec{v}_z - \vec{v}_{z(\text{percolation})} \\
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where $\vec{v}_{water}$ is the velocity vector of the water particle, $\vec{v}_{x}$ and $\vec{v}_{z}$ are the local velocity vectors of the solid state mantle or crust, and $\vec{v}_{z(percolation)}$ is a imposed constant upward percolation velocity (10 $cm/year$). We implicitly neglect kinetics of reactions, as material properties of markers change instantaneously at equilibrium reactions.

## Rheologic sensitivity tests on plate coupling {#rheologicSensitivity}

Numerical modelling practitioners simulating \glspl{sz} approach mechanical coupling between plates differently. A simple, but highly effective approach, is prescribing a layer of arbitrary strength extending from the surface to an arbitrary depth or temperature along the plate interface. This approach effectively inhibits transfer of shear stress between plates and is analogous to controlling a no-slip condition at the interface (plates move with the same velocity vector beyond the coupling point). Numerous models use this method [e.g., @peacock1996; @peacock1999b; @wada2009; @syracuse2010] in part because it allows fine-tuning to specific \gls{sz} configurations. Serpentine-or talc-rich horizons are typically invoked to justify implementing such a condition at shallow interface depths.

The experiments outlined in Section \@ref(numMethods) do not explicitly define coupling, but rather use a rheologic model that explicitly follows experimentally determined flow laws and mineral stability fields. This approach conceptually follows and extends petrologic explanations for a weak interface [@hyndman2003; @peacock1999a]. As a corollary, dehydration of serpentine, or possibly talc, at higher temperatures must strengthen the interface [@agard2016]. Noting that talc is unstable at P $>$ 2.0 $GPa$ in an ultramafic rock [@schmidt1998], a serpentine rheology is arguably the most relevant candidate responsible for a strength increase, and thus coupling, at \gls{pt} conditions inferred for coupling in active \glspl{sz} [@wada2009; @syracuse2010].

Sensitivity tests of the rheologic model presented in Section \@ref(rheologicModel) were run using diverse experiments adjusting the rheology of serpentine (compared to Table \@ref(tab:materials)), the shape and position of the antigorite-out reaction (compared to \@ref(eq:antstab)), and certain hydrodynamic parameters. For brevity, these results are not presented here. The experiments included:

1. antigorite $\leftarrow$ wet olivine flow law
2. antigorite and wet olivine $\leftarrow$ dry olivine flow law
3. isothermal antigorite reaction at 690 $^{\circ}C$
4. antigorite reaction isothermal Clapeyron slope at 715 $^{\circ}C$
5. antigorite reaction with positive linear Clapeyron slope
6. linear release of $H_{2}O$ with depth
7. no fluid-induced weakening

Only experiments 5 and 7 listed above were inconsistent with the results presented Section \@ref(chpt2Results). Experiment 5 results in transient \glspl{cd} and discontinuous antigorite stability in the upper-plate mantle, whereas experiment 7 results in two-sided subduction [e.g., @gerya2008]. These sensitivity experiments imply numerical coupling mechanisms are mostly contingent on fluid flux to the upper-plate mantle and the implementation of serpentine stability. The experiments also show coupling is relatively insensitive to the exact flow law parameters.

## Surface heat flow

Below is \gls{shf} calculated at 2 $km$ beneath the topographic surface at approximately 10 $Ma$ for all numerical experiments presented in Chapter \@ref(chpt2).

## Kriging system and optimization {#krigeOpt}

### Ordinary Kriging

This study applies isotropic ordinary Kriging methods under the following general assumptions:

- $\hat{\gamma}(h)$ is directionally invariant (isotropic)
- $\hat{\gamma}(h)$ is evaluated in two-dimensions and neglects elevation
- The first and second moments of $Z(u)$ are assumed to follow the conditions:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    &E[Z(u)] = \hat{Z}(u) = constant \\
    &E[(Z(u + h) - \hat{Z}(u))(Z(u) - \hat{Z}(u))] = C(h)
  \end{aligned}
  (\#eq:krigeAssumptions)
\end{equation}

where $h$ is the lag distance, $C(h)$ is the covariance function, $E[Z(u)]$ is the expected value of the random variable $Z(u)$, and $\hat{Z}(u)$ is the arithmetic mean of $Z(u)$.

Equation \@ref(eq:krigeAssumptions) is known as "weak second-order stationarity". It assumes the underlying probability distribution of the observations $Z(u)$ does not change in space and the covariance $C(h)$ only depends on the distance $h$ between two observations. These assumptions are expected to be valid in cases where the underlying natural process is stochastic, spatially continuous, and has the property of additivity such that $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n Z(u_i)$ has the same meaning as $Z(u)$ [@bardossy1997].

The following are two illustrative cases where Equation \@ref(eq:krigeAssumptions) is likely valid:

> The thickness of a sedimentary unit with a homogeneous concentration of radioactive elements can be approximated by $q_s = q_b + \int A \,dz$, where $q_b$ is a constant heat flux entering the bottom of the layer and $A$ is the heat production within the layer with thickness $z$ [@furlong2013]. If one has two samples, $Z(u_1) = 31~mW/m^2$ and $Z(u_2) = 30.5~mW/m^2$, their corresponding thicknesses would be $Z'(u_1) = 1000~m$ and $Z'(u_2) = 500~m$ for $A = 0.001~mW/m^3$ and $q_b = 30~mW/m^2$. The variable, $Z(u)$, in this case is additive because the arithmetic mean of the samples is a good approximation of the average sedimentary layer thickness, $(Z(u_1) + Z(u_2)) / 2 = 750~m$.

> The age of young oceanic lithosphere can be approximated by $q_s(t) = kT_b(\pi\kappa t)^{-1/2}$, where $q_s(t)$ is the surface heat flow of a plate with age, $t$, $T_b$ is the temperature at the base of the plate, $k$ is thermal conductivity, and $\kappa = k/\rho C_p$ is thermal diffusivity [@stein1992]. Using reasonable values for $k = 3.138~W/mK$, $\rho = 3330~kg/m^3$, $C_p = 1171~J/kgK$, $T_b = 1350^{\circ}C$, two samples, $Z(u_1) = 180~mW/m^2$ and $Z(u_2) = 190~mW/m^2$, would correspond to plates with ages of $Z'(u_1) = 10~Ma$, and $Z'(u_2) = 9~Ma$, respectively. Since $Z(u_1) + Z(u_2) / 2 = 185~mW/m^2$ and $Z'(185~mW/m^2) = 9.5~Ma = Z'(u_1) + Z'(u_2) / 2$, the variable $Z(u)$ in this case is also additive.

Equation \@ref(eq:krigeAssumptions) is likely invalid in regions that transition among two or more tectonic regimes, however. For example, the expected (mean) heat flow $E[Z(u)]$ will change when moving from a spreading center to a subduction zone and thus $E[Z(u)] \neq constant$ over the region of interest. In other words, stationarity is violated and Kriging estimates will become spurious.

The second step is fitting a variogram model $\gamma(h)$ to the experimental variogram. This study fits six popular variogram models with sills (or theoretical sills) to the experimental variogram. The models are defined as [@pebesma2004]:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    Bes &\leftarrow \gamma(h) = 1 - \frac{h}{a}\ K_1\left(\frac{h}{a}\right) \quad \text{for } \  h \geq 0 \\
    Cir &\leftarrow \gamma(h) =
    \begin{cases}
      \frac{2}{\pi}\frac{h}{a}\ \sqrt{1-\left(\frac{h}{a}\right)^2} + \frac{2}{\pi}\ arcsin\left(\frac{h}{a}\right) \quad \text{for } \  0 \leq h \leq a \\
      n + s \quad \text{for } \  h > a
    \end{cases} \\
    Exp &\leftarrow \gamma(h) = 1 - exp\left(\frac{-h}{a}\right) \quad \text{for } \  h \geq 0 \\
    Gau &\leftarrow \gamma(h) = 1 - exp\left(\left[\frac{-h}{a}\right]^2\right) \quad \text{for } \  h \geq 0 \\
    Lin &\leftarrow \gamma(h) =
    \begin{cases}
      \frac{h}{a} \quad \text{for } \  0 \leq h \leq a \\
      n + s \quad \text{for } \  h > a
    \end{cases} \\
    Sph &\leftarrow \gamma(h) =
    \begin{cases}
      \frac{3}{2}\frac{h}{a} - \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{h}{a}\right)^3 \quad \text{for } \  0 \leq h \leq a \\
      n + s \quad \text{for } \  h > a
    \end{cases} \\
  \end{aligned}
  (\#eq:varMods)
\end{equation}

where $n$ is the nugget, $s$ is the sill, $a$ is the effective range, $K_1$ is a modified Bessel function. The models are Bessel, Circular, Exponential, Gaussian, Linear, and Spherical. For models without explicit sills (Bes, Exp, Gau), the effective range $a$ is the distance where the variogram reaches 95% of its maximum defined as 4$a$, 3$a$, and $\sqrt{3}a$ for Bes, Exp, and Gau, respectively [@graler2016; @pebesma2004]. The function `fit.variogram` in `gstat` is used to try all variogram models. The best model is selected by the minimum weighted least squares [@pebesma2004] error with weights proportional to the number of points in each lag divided by the squared lag distance $wt = N(h)_k/h_k^2)$.

Ordinary Kriging is used for interpolation, which estimates unknown observations $\hat{Z}(u)$ as a linear combination of all known observations [@bardossy1997]:

\begin{equation}
  \hat{Z}(u) = \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i Z(u_i)
  (\#eq:linEstimate)
\end{equation}

The conditions in Equation \@ref(eq:krigeAssumptions) set up a constrained minimization problem that can be solved with a system of linear equations. The expected value of $Z(u)$ is assumed to be the mean according to \@ref(eq:krigeAssumptions), so the weights must be:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    E[\hat{Z}(u)] &= \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i E[Z(u_i)] \\
    \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i &= 1
  \end{aligned}
  (\#eq:unbiased)
\end{equation}

This constraint is known as the unbiased condition, which states that the sum of the weights must equal one. However, there is an infinite set of real numbers one could use for the weights, $\lambda_i$. The goal is to find the set of weights in Equation \@ref(eq:linEstimate) that minimizes the estimation variance. This can be solved by minimizing the covariance function, $C(h)$ from Equation \@ref(eq:krigeAssumptions):

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    & \sigma^2(u) = Var[Z(u) - \hat{Z}(u)] = \\
    & E\left[(Z(u) - \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i Z(u_i))^2\right] = \\
    & E\left[Z(u)^2 + \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_j \lambda_i Z(u_j)Z(u_i) - 2 \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i Z(u_i)Z(u)\right] = \\
    & C(0) + \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_j \lambda_i C(u_i - u_j) - 2 \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i C(u_i - u)
  \end{aligned}
  (\#eq:minVar)
\end{equation}

Minimizing Equation \@ref(eq:minVar) with respect to the unbiased condition (Equation \@ref(eq:unbiased)), yields the best linear unbiased estimator [BLUE, @bardossy1997] for Equation \@ref(eq:linEstimate) and together comprise the Kriging system of equations. The functions `krige` and `krige.cv` in `gstat` are used for \gls{shf} interpolation and error estimation by k-fold cross-validation [@pebesma2004].

### Optimization with `nloptr` {#nloptr}

Achieving accurate Kriging results depends on one's choice of many Kriging parameters, $\Theta$. In this study, we investigate a set of parameters:

\begin{equation} 
  \Theta = \{model,\ n,\ c,\ n_{max},\ l\}
  (\#eq:params)
\end{equation}

where $model$ is one of the variogram models defined in Equation \@ref(eq:varMods), $n$ is the number of lags, $c$ is a lag cutoff proportionality constant, $n_{max}$ is the maximum point-pairs for local Kriging, and $l$ is a horizontal lag shift constant. The lag cutoff constant $c$ controls the maximum separation distance between pairs of points used to calculate the experimental variogram (i.e. the x-axis range or "width" of the experimental variogram). The horizontal lag shift constant $l$ removes the first few lags from being evaluated by effectively shifting all lags to the left proportionally by $l$. This is necessary to avoid negative ranges when fitting experimental variograms with anomalously high variances at small lag distances.

The goal is to find $\Theta$ such that the Kriging function $f(x_i;\ \Theta)$ gives the minimum error defined by a cost function $C(\Theta)$, which represents the overall goodness of fit of the interpolation. This study defines a cost function that simultaneously considers errors between the experimental variogram $\hat{\gamma}(h)$ and modelled variogram $\gamma(h)$, and between \gls{shf} observations $Z(u_i)$ and Kriging estimates $\hat{Z}(u)$ [after @li2018]:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    C(\Theta) &= w_{vgrm}\ C_{vgrm}(\Theta) + w_{interp}\ C_{interp}(\Theta) \\
    &w_{vgrm} + w_{interp} = 1
  \end{aligned}
  (\#eq:cost)
\end{equation}

where $C_{vgrm}(\Theta)$ is the normalized \glsfirst{rmse} evaluated during variogram fitting and $C_{interp}(\Theta)$ is the normalized \gls{rmse} evaluated during Kriging. Weighted ordinary least squares is used to evaluate $C_{vgrm}(\Theta)$, whereas k-fold cross-validation is used to evaluate $C_{interp}(\Theta)$. K-fold splits the dataset $|Z(u_i)|$ into $k$ equal intervals, removes observations from an interval, and then estimates the removed observations by fitting a variogram model to data in the remaining $k-1$ intervals. This process is repeated over all $k$ intervals so that the whole dataset has been cross-validated. The final expression to minimize becomes:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    &C(\Theta) = \\
    &\frac{w_{vgrm}}{\sigma_{vgrm}}\ \left(\frac{1}{N(h)}\ \sum_{k=1}^{N}\ w(h_k)\ [\hat{\gamma}(h_k)-\gamma(h_k;\ \Theta)]^2\right)^{1/4} + \\
    &\frac{w_{interp}}{\sigma_{interp}}\ \left(\frac{1}{M}\ \sum_{i=1}^{M}\ [Z(u_i)-\hat{Z}(u_i;\ \Theta)]^2\right)^{1/2}
  \end{aligned}
  (\#eq:costExp)
\end{equation}

where $N(h)$ is the number of point-pairs used to evaluate the experimental variogram and $w(h_k) = N(h)_k/h_k^2$ are weights defining the importance of the $kth$ lag on the variogram model fit.  $Z(u_i)$ and $\hat{Z}(u_i;\ \Theta)$ are the observed and estimated values, respectively, and $M$ is the number of measurements in $|Z(u_i)|$. The \glspl{rmse} are normalized by dividing by $\sigma_{vgrm}$ and $\sigma_{interp}$, which represent the standard deviation of the experimental variogram $\hat{\gamma}(h)$ and \gls{shf} observations $Z(u_i)$, respectively. The weights $w_{vgrm}$ and $w_{interp}$ were varied between 0 and 1 to test the effects on $C(\Theta)$. Preferred weights of $w_{vgrm}$ = $w_{interp}$ = 0.5 are selected to balance the effects of $C_{vgrm}(\Theta)$ and $C_{interp}(\Theta)$ on the cost function.

Minimization of $C(\Theta)$ is achieved by non-linear constrained optimization using algorithms defined in the `R` package `nloptr` [@ypma2014] with bounds in Table \@ref(tab:nloptrBounds). Both global and local search methods were applied with similar success. Please see [the official documentation](https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/NLopt_Introduction/) for more information on `nloptr` and available optimization algorithms. The run used to produce the visualizations in Chapter \@ref(chpt3) uses the `NLOPT_LN_BOBYQA` option with 50 max iterations, cross-validation with k-folds equal to half of the number of observations in the evaluated segment, and cost function weights of $w_{vgrm}$ = $w_{interp}$ = 0.5 (Figure \@ref(fig:optTrace)). All data, code, and instructions to reproduce results in this chapter can be found at \url{https://github.com/buchanankerswell/kerswell_kohn_backarc}.

(ref:optTraceCap) Cost function minimization for Kriging interpolations presented in Chapter \@ref(chpt3). Most variogram models (panels) converge on a local optimum for most segments after 15-20 iterations. Gaussian models are the least stable and produce spurious results. See text for bound constraints and other options.

## Interpolation comparisons {#interpDiffAppendix}

Below are all interpolation comparisons not presented in the main text of Chapter \@ref(chpt3) and summary statistics for interpolation uncertainty differences by segment.

(ref:sigmaDiffSummaryPlotCap) Summary of differences between Similarity and Kriging uncertainties. Note that differences are computed as [Similarity $-$ Krige]. Differences are centered at slightly negative values with median differences ranging from `r min(sigma.diff$median)` to `r max(sigma.diff$median)` $mWm^{-2}$, and broadly distributed with interquartile ranges from `r min(sigma.diff$IQR)` to `r max(sigma.diff$IQR)` $mWm^{-2}$ and long tails extending from `r min(sigma.diff$min)` to `r max(sigma.diff$max)` $mWm^{-2}$. Distributions are asymmetric and irregular, indicating regional differences in uncertainty across interpolation domains. Negative medians indicate greater uncertainties by Kriging compared to Similarity. Distributions are colored by quantiles (25%, 50%, 75%). Similarity data from @lucazeau2019. Please refer to Figure \@ref(fig:diffSummaryPlot) for estimate differences.

## Thermal parameter effects

(ref:phiDensityCap) Marker PT distribution by thermal parameter $\Phi$. Changing patterns to the probability density of recovered markers (filled grey contours) with respect to thermal parameter appear non-systematic. A general change in morphology towards flatter, more segregated bimodal distributions is observed with increasing thermal parameter. The more continuous distributions for $\Phi$ of 13, 22, 34, and 44 stand out because these models correspond to the slowest-converging simulations (see Figure \@ref(fig:rec_rate)).

## Marker classifications {#vis}

The following pages contain visualizations of marker classifications, marker PT distributions, and summary geodynamic snapshots for all 64 \gls{sz} simulations presented in Chapter \@ref(chpt4). All data and visualizations are available online at \url{https://github.com/buchanankerswell/kerswell_et_al_marx}.

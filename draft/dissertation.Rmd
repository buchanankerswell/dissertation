## Abstract

Heat fluxing through the Earth's surface provides indirect observations of \glsfirst{pts} fields deep in \glspl{sz}. Global heat flow databases, therefore, are invaluable for generating and testing belief about \gls{sz} geodynamics. Here we argue that investigating \glsfirst{shf} in two-dimensions by interpolation, rather than in one-dimension by projection, forms better interpretations about spatial continuity of deep processes. We directly compare interpolations based on the First (spatial continuity) and Third (similarity) Laws of Geography applied to the most updated global heat flow database. We observe inconsistent spatial patterns and of \gls{shf} in magnitude and variance near subduction zones, regardless of interpolation method. The implications include discontinuous \gls{pts} fields at depth, countering hypotheses of commonly thin upper plate lithospheres and mechanical coupling depths among subduction zones. Strategic scaling of \gls{shf} datasets will improve interpolation precision and confidence---leading to better tools for distinguishing differences within and among \glspl{sz}. We propose new data acquisition and composite interpolation schema as avenues for future \gls{sz} research.
